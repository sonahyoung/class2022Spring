Did I say that out loud\\nI told mom and dad last night, they seemed to take it pretty well\\nOh really, so that hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3:00 A.M., \"I\\'ll never have grandchildren, I\\'ll never have grandchildren.\" was what?Ê A wrong number\\nSorry\\nAlright Ross, look. You\\'re feeling a lot of pain right now. You\\'re angry. You\\'re hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is\\nStrip joint! C\\'mon, you\\'re single! Have some hormones\\nI don\\'t want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again\\nAnd I just want a million dollars! (He extends his hand hopefully\\nRachel?\\nOh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went to your building and you weren\\'t there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are\\nCan I get you some coffee\\n(pointing at Rachel) De-caff. (to All) Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. (to Rachel) This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross\\nHi, sure\\nHi\\nSo you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids\\nOh God... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden- (to the waitress that brought her coffee)Sweet \\'n\\' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that\\'s when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y\\'know, I mean, I always knew looked familiar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering \\'Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?\\'. (to Monica) So anyway I just didn\\'t know where to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you\\'re the only person I knew who lived here in the city\\nWho wasn\\'t invited to the wedding\\nOoh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn\\'t be an issue... [Scene: Monica\\'s Apartment, everyone is there and watching a Spanish Soap on TV and are trying to figure out what is going on\\nNow I\\'m guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she\\'s really not happy about it\\n(imitating the characters) Tuna or egg salad?Ê Decide\\n(in a deep voice) I\\'ll have whatever Christine is having\\n(on phone) Daddy, I just... I can\\'t marry him! I\\'m sorry. I just don\\'t love him. Well, it matters to me\\n(re TV) Ooh, she should not be wearing those pants\\nI say push her down the stairs\\nC\\'mon Daddy, listen to me! It\\'s like, it\\'s like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, \\'You\\'re a shoe! You\\'re a shoe, you\\'re a shoe, you\\'re a shoe!\\'. And today I just stopped and I said, \\'What if I don\\'t wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y\\'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I\\'m not saying I want you to buy me a hat, I\\'m saying I am a ha- It\\'s a metaphor, Daddy\\nYou can see where he\\'d have trouble\\nLook Daddy, it\\'s my life. Well maybe I\\'ll just stay here with Monica\\nWell, I guess we\\'ve established who\\'s staying here with Monica..\\nWell, maybe that\\'s my decision. Well, maybe I don\\'t need your money. Wait!! Wait, I said maybe!\\nJust breathe, breathe.. that\\'s it. Just try to think of nice calm things..\\n(sings) Raindrops on roses and rabbits and kittens, (Rachel and Monica turn to look at her.) bluebells and sleighbells and- something with mittens... La la la la...something and noodles with string.Ê These are a few..\\nI\\'m all better now\\n(grins and walks to the kitchen and says to Chandler and Joey.) I helped\\nOkay, look, this is probably for the best, y\\'know? Independence. Taking control of your life.Ê The whole, \\'hat\\' thing\\n(comforting her) And hey, you need anything, you can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall. And he\\'s away a lot\\nJoey, stop hitting on her! It\\'s her wedding day\\nWhat, like there\\'s a rule or something\\nPlease don\\'t do that again, it\\'s a horrible sound\\n(over the intercom) It\\'s, uh, it\\'s Paul\\nOh God, is it 6:30?Ê Buzz him in\\nWho\\'s Paul\\nPaul the Wine Guy, Paul\\nMaybe. Joey: Wait. Your \\'not a real date\\' tonight is with Paul the Wine Guy\\nHe finally asked you out\\nYes\\nOoh, this is a Dear Diary moment\\nRach, wait, I can cancel..\\nPlease, no, go, that\\'d be fine\\n(to Ross) Are, are you okay? I mean, do you want me to stay\\n(choked voice) That\\'d be good..\\n(horrified) Really\\n(normal voice) No, go on! It\\'s Paul the Wine Guy\\nWhat does that mean? Ê Does he sell it, drink it, or just complain a lot? (Chandler doesn\\'t know\\nHi, come in! Paul, this is.. (They are all lined up next to the door.)... everybody, everybody, this is Paul\\nHey! Paul! Hi! The Wine Guy! Hey\\nI\\'m sorry, I didn\\'t catch your name.

(Shows Paul in) Two seconds\\nOoh, I just pulled out four eyelashes. That can\\'t be good\\nYeah\\nHere\\'s a little tip, she really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot over and over and over again until it starts to get a little red\\n(yelling from the bedroom) Shut up, Joey\\nSo Rachel, what\\'re you, uh... what\\'re you up to tonight\\nWell, I was kinda supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing\\nRight, you\\'re not even getting your honeymoon, God.. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year... talk about your- (thinks) -big lizards... Anyway, if you don\\'t feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are coming over to help me put together my new furniture\\n(deadpan) Yes, and we\\'re very excited about it\\nWell actually thanks, but I think I\\'m just gonna hang out here tonight.Ê It\\'s been kinda a long day\\nOkay, sure\\nHey Pheebs, you wanna help\\nOh, I wish I could, but I don\\'t want to\\nThe Subway, Phoebe is singing for change\\n(singing) Love is sweet as summer showers, love is a wondrous work of art, but your love oh your love, your love...is like a giant pigeon...crapping on my heart.Ê La-la-la-la-la- (some guy gives her some change and to that guy) Thank you. (sings) La-la-la-la...ohhh\\nRoss\\'s Apartment, the guys are there assembling furniture\\n(squatting and reading the instructions) I\\'m supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little worm guys.

How did you get through it\\n-leg\\n(laughing) That\\'s one way! Me, I- I went for the watch\\nYou actually broke her watch?Ê Wow!Ê The worst thing I ever did was, I-I shredded by boyfriend\\'s favorite bath towel\\nOoh, steer clear of you\\nThat\\'s right. [Scene: Monica\\'s Apartment, Rachel is talking on the phone and pacing\\nBarry, I\\'m sorry... I am so sorry... I know you probably think that this is all about what I said the other day about you making love with your socks on, but it isn\\'t... it isn\\'t, it\\'s about me, and I ju- (She stops talking and dials the phone.) Hi, machine cut me off again... anyway...look, look, I know that some girl is going to be incredibly lucky to become Mrs. Barry Finkel, but it isn\\'t me, it\\'s not me.Ê And not that I have any idea who me is right now, but you just have to give me a chance too...

(Chandler hits what he is working on with a hammer and it collapses\\nThat only took me an hour\\nLook, Ross, you gotta understand, between us we haven\\'t had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento. Ê You, however have had the love of a woman for four years. Ê Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and that is why we don\\'t do it!Ê I don\\'t think that was my point\\nYou know what the scariest part is? What if there\\'s only one woman for everybody, y\\'know? I mean what if you get one woman- and that\\'s it? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her..\\nWhat are you talking about? \\'One woman\\'? That\\'s like saying there\\'s only one flavor of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something, Ross. There\\'s lots of flavors out there. There\\'s Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing! Cherry Vanilla. You could get \\'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream!

He said \\'we should do it again\\', that\\'s good, right\\nUh, no. Loosely translated \\'We should do this again\\' means \\'You will never see me naked\\'\\nSince when\\nSince always. It\\'s like dating language. Y\\'know, like \\'It\\'s not you\\' means \\'It is you\\'\\nOr \\'You\\'re such a nice guy\\' means \\'I\\'m gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you\\'\\nOr, or, y\\'know, um, \\'I think we should see other people\\' means \\'Ha, ha, I already am\\'\\nAnd everybody knows this\\nYeah. Cushions the blow\\nYeah, it\\'s like when you\\'re a kid, and your parents put your dog to sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm\\nThat\\'s funny, that, no, because, uh, our parents actually did, uh, send our dog off to live on a farm\\nUh, Ross\\nWhat?

No. Give it to me\\nNo no no, I am not giving you a cigarette\\nIt\\'s fine, it\\'s fine. Look, do you wanna get this part, or not? Here\\nDon\\'t think of it as a cigarette. Think of it as the thing that\\'s been missing from your hand. When you\\'re holding it, you feel right. You feel complete\\nY\\'miss it\\nNah, not so much. Alright, now we smoke. (Takes a puff.) Oh.. my.. God. (He continues to smoke\\nNo, no, no.

I mean, I bring a guy home, and within five minutes they\\'re all over him. I mean, they\\'re like- coyotes, picking off the weak members of the herd\\nListen. As someone who\\'s seen more than her fair share of bad beef, I\\'ll tell you: that is not such a terrible thing. I mean, they\\'re your friends, they\\'re just looking out after you\\nI know. I just wish that once, I\\'d bring a guy home that they actually liked\\nWell, you do realise the odds of that happening are a little slimmer if they never get to meet the guy.\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, Chandler is smoking out on the balcony, Phoebe is absent\\nLet it go, Ross\\nYeah, well, you didn\\'t know Chi Chi\\nDo you all promise\\nYeah!

Let\\'s start with the way he kept picking at- no, I\\'m sorry, I can\\'t do this, can\\'t do this. We loved him\\nLoved him! Yeah! He\\'s great\\nWait a minute! We\\'re talking about someone that I\\'m going out with\\nYeah\\nAnd did you notice...? (She spreads her thumb and index finger\\n(reluctantly) Yeah\\nKnow what was great? The way his smile was kinda crooked\\nYes, yes! Like the man in the shoe\\n...What shoe\\nFrom the nursery rhyme. \\'There was a crooked man, Who had a crooked smile, Who lived in a shoe, For a... while..\\n...So I think Alan will become the yardstick against which all future boyfriends will be measured\\nWhat future boyfriends? Nono, I th- I think this could be, y\\'know, it\\nReally\\nOh, yeah. I\\'d marry him just for his David Hasselhof impression alone.

D\\'you ever think that Alan is maybe.. sometimes.\\nWhat\\n..I dunno, a little too Alan\\nWell, no. That\\'s impossible.

Like, collect all five\\nDoes, um, anyone wanna see\\nNooo\\nOh, hey, don\\'t do that! Cut it out\\nIt\\'s worse than the thumb\\nHey, this is so unfair\\nOh, why is it unfair\\nSo I have a flaw! Big deal! Like Joey\\'s constant knuckle-cracking isn\\'t annoying? And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? And Monica, with that snort when she laughs? I mean, what the hell is that thing? ...I accept all those flaws, why can\\'t you accept me for this\\n...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody\\nWell, I-I could live without it\\nWell, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair\\nOh, now, don\\'t listen to him, Pheebs, I think it\\'s endearing\\nOh, (Imitating Ross) \"you do, do you\"\\nYou know, there\\'s nothing wrong with speaking correctly\\n\"Indeed there isn\\'t\"...

This is what I\\'m doing now\\nWaitressing\\nOkay, I\\'m not just waitressing. I\\'m.. I, um... I write the specials on the specials board, and, uh... and I, uh...

How was it with your friends? (She and Phoebe scream.) Okay! How would you like some Tiki Death Punch? (She pours the contents of the blender into some glasses\\nWhat\\'s that\\nOkay. (Grabs the blender and starts to drink\\nWe thought since Phoebe was staying over tonight we\\'d have kinda like a slumber party thing.

But we can prep the guy\\nUh, Rach, it\\'s the Visa card people\\nOh, God, ask them what they want\\n(on phone) Could you please tell me what this is in reference to? (Listens) Yes, hold on. (To Rachel) Um, they say there\\'s been some unusual activity on your account\\nBut I haven\\'t used my card in weeks\\nThat is the unusual activity. Look, they just wanna see if you\\'re okay\\nThey wanna know if I\\'m okay. Okay.. they wanna know if I\\'m okay, okay, let\\'s see. Well, let\\'s see, the FICA guys took all my money, everyone I know is either getting married, or getting promoted, or getting pregnant, and I\\'m getting coffee! And it\\'s not even for me! So if that sounds like I\\'m okay, okay, then you can tell them I\\'m okay, okay\\n(pauses then on the phone) Uh- Rachel has left the building, can you call back\\nAlright, c\\'mon! (Miserably) Let\\'s play Twister\\nMadison Square Garden, the guys are trying to find their seats\\n(squeezing past people) Sorry, sorry... Uh-oh\\nWhat? There was ice there that night with Carol? Plastic seats? Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans\\nNo, actually I was just saying it looks like we\\'re not sitting together. But now you mention it, there was ice there that night... It was the first frost..\\nC\\'mon, sit. Just sit down, sit\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, they\\'re all hanging out in the living room\\nYou should feel great about yourself! You\\'re doing this amazing independence thing\\nMonica, what is so amazing? I gave up, like, everything. And for what\\nYou are just like Jack\\n...Jack from downstairs\\nNo, Jack and the Beanstalk\\nAh, the other Jack\\nYeah, right! See, he gave up something, but then he got those magic beans. And then he woke up, and there was this, this big plant outside his window, full of possibilities and stuff.. And he lived in a village, and you live in the Village.\\nOkay, but Pheebs, Pheebs, Jack gave up a cow, I gave up an orthodontist\\nOh, see, Jack did love the cow\\nBut see, it was a plan. Y\\'know, it was clear. It was figured out, and now everything\\'s just kinda like..\\nFloopy\\nYeah\\nSo what, you\\'re not the only one. I mean, half the time we don\\'t know where we\\'re going. You\\'ve just gotta figure at some point it\\'s all gonna come together, and it\\'s just gonna be... un-floopy\\nOh, like that\\'s a word\\nOkay, but Monica, what if- what if it doesn\\'t come together\\n...Pheebs\\nOh, well... \\'cause.... you just...

Shoot\\nHey, look, we\\'re on that TV thing\\nAn Emergency Room, Chandler and Joey are leading Ross in\\n(to the receptionist)\\'Scuse me\\n(holds up her handÑshe is on the phone) It says to call this number if you\\'re not completely satisfied with this candy bar. Well, I\\'m not completely satisfied\\nListen, it\\'s kind of an emergency. Well, I guess you know that, or we\\'d be in the predicament room. (The receptionist glares at him\\n(on phone) Hold on. (To Chandler) Fill these out, sit over there. (Tosses him some forms\\n(jumping to his feet) Look, I don\\'t wanna make any trouble, okay, but I\\'m in a lot of pain here, alright? My face is dented\\nWell, you\\'ll have to wait your turn\\nWell, how long do you think it\\'ll be\\n(sarcastic) Any minute now\\nHey, this- (she gives him a look and the guys back off) Heyy..\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, the slumber party continues\\nI\\'m so sorry, you guys. I didn\\'t mean to bring you down\\nNo, you were right. I don\\'t have a plan. (There\\'s a knock on the door\\n(yelling from outside) Pizza guy\\nThank God. Food.

We ordered a fat-free crust with extra cheese\\nWait, you\\'re not \\'G.Stephanopoulos?\\' Man, my dad\\'s gonna kill me\\n(leaping off of the couch and runs up) Wait! Did you say \\'G.Stephanopoulos\\nYeah. This one goes across the street, I must have given him yours. Oh, bonehead, bonehead\\nWait, was this a-a small mediterranean guy with curiously intelligent good looks\\nYeah, that sounds about right\\nWas he wearing a stunning blue suit\\nAnd-and a power tie\\nNo, pretty much just a towel\\n(staggered) Oh God\\nSo you guys want me to take this back\\nAre you nuts?! We\\'ve got George Stephanopoulos\\' pizza! (Rachel pays him, Monica grabs some binoculars, and runs to the window\\nUh, Pheebs? Who\\'s George Snuffalopagus\\nBig Bird\\'s friend\\nI see pizza\\nOh, I wanna see! Lemme see! Lemme see! (She runs up and takes the binoculars\\nHello? Who are we spying on\\nWhite House adviser?

I mean, that guy with the toe thing? Who\\'s he sleeping with? (She slides the gladd panel over and Chandler talks through it in a loud voice.) Oh, c\\'mon Dora, don\\'t be mad... I know we both said some things we didn\\'t mean, but that doesn\\'t mean we still don\\'t love each other. (To the waiting room.) Y\\'know, I feel like I\\'ve lost her.. (She slides the panel back, he turns, and it takes him by surprise.) Ba-\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, the girls are all out on the balcony\\nLight still out\\nYeah\\nOh. Maybe they\\'re- napping\\nOh please, they\\'re having sex\\nShut up\\nSo, whaddya think George is like\\nI think he\\'s shy\\nYeah\\nYeah. I think you have to draw him out. And then- when you do- he\\'s a preppy animal\\nThe Emergency Room, Ross is still going on about his first night with Carol\\nI remember the moonlight coming through the window- and her face had the most incredible glow\\nYes, the moon, the glow, the magical feeling, you did this part- Could I get some painkillers over here, please\\nHe\\'s right, enough, already. What is the big deal about today? So you slept with her for the first time, so what? You slept with her for seven years after that\\nLook, it\\'s just a little more complicated..\\nWell, what? What? What is it? That she left you? That she likes women? That she left you for another woman that likes women\\nLittle louder, okay, I think there\\'s a man on the twelfth floor in a coma that didn\\'t quite hear you..\\nThen what\\nMy first time with Carol was..\\nWhat\\nIt was my first time\\nWith Carol? (Ross gives him a look.) Oh\\nSo in your whole life, you\\'ve only been with oneÑ(He gets a look too)Ñoh\\nWhoah, boy, hockey was a big mistake!

(She sits up and the cushion she was leaning against falls off of the balcony.) Anyway- The valentine Tommy Rollerson left in your locker was really from me\\nExcuse me?\\nHello? Like he was really gonna send you one? (To Phoebe) She was a big girl\\nReally. Well, at least \\'big girls\\' don\\'t pee in their pants in seventh grade\\nI was laughing! You made me laugh\\nThere he is! There he is\\nWhere\\nRight- where we\\'ve been looking all night\\nHe is so cute\\nOh, George, baby, drop the towel\\nYeah, drop it! Drop the towel!

Y\\'know, it\\'s sweet, it\\'s romantic..\\nReally\\nNo, you kidding? The guy\\'s a freak.\\nHey, buddy\\nHi. (He is wearing a piece of steel bandaged to his nose.Ê He tosses some forms onto reception desk\\n(sarcastic) Oh, that\\'s attractive\\nOh, I thought you were great in Silence of the Lambs. Oh come on, admit it! All things considered, you had fun tonight\\nFun? Where was the fun? Tell me specifically, which part was the fun part? Where\\'s my puck\\nOh, ah- the kid has it\\nThe kid...? (To the kid) Excuse me, uh, that\\'s, that\\'s my puck\\nI found it. Finders keepers, losers weepers. (Ross looks at Chandler for help\\nYou gotta do it, man\\n(to the kid) Oh yeah? Well, I\\'m rubber, you\\'re glue, whateverÑ(to Chandler)Ñcan\\'t do it. (to the kid) Listen, uh- gimme back my puck\\nNo\\n\\'Yes\\', how about. C\\'mere. Gimme\\nNo! No! (They start to fight over it\\nHey! Hey! No rough holding in my ER\\n(tries to snatch it from the kid) GIVE ME MY PUCK!\\n...Now that was fun\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, Joey and the girls are playing twister\\n(Doing the spinning) Okay, Monica: Right foot red\\nCould\\'ve played Monopoly, but nooooo\\nThanks\\nOkay, Pheebs: Right hand blue. (Phoebe has to bend over.)Good\\nHello? Oh, uh, Rachel, it\\'s the Visa card people\\nOh, okay. Will you take my place\\nAlright. (on phone) Yes, this is Rachel\\nNooo! (She grabs the phone and Chandler takes her place on the mat.) (On phone) Hello? (Listens) Oh, yeah, no, I know, I-I haven\\'t been using it much. (Listens) Oh, well, thanks, but, I\\'m okay, really\\nGreen. To the green\\n(on phone) I\\'ve got magic beans. (Listens) Never-never mind\\nTo the left, to the left- aww\\n(on phone) Ohhh... I\\'m fine\\nCentral Perk, all six are there\\nWould you let it go? It\\'s not that big a deal\\nNot that big a deal? It\\'s amazing. Ok, you just reach in there, there\\'s one little maneuver, and bam, a bra right out the sleeve. All right, as far as I\\'m concerned, there is nothing a guy can do that even comes close. Am I right\\nCome on! You guys can pee standing up\\nWe can? All right, I\\'m tryin\\' that\\nOk, you know what blows my mind? Women can see breasts any time they want. You just look down and there they are. How you get any work done is beyond me\\nOh, ok, you know what I don\\'t get? The way guys can do so many mean things, and then not even care\\nMultiple orgasms\\nCentral Perk, all are there\\nSo, Saturday night, the big night, date night, Saturday night, Sat-ur-day night\\nNo plans, huh\\nNot a one\\nNot even, say, breaking up with Janice\\nOh, right, right, shut up\\nChandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone. You just gotta do it\\nNo, I know, but it\\'s just so hard, you know? I mean, you\\'re sitting there with her, she has no idea what\\'s happening, and then you finally get up the courage to do it, and there\\'s the horrible awkward moment when you\\'ve handed her the note\\nWhy do you have to break up with her? Be a man, just stop calling\\nYou know, if you want, I\\'ll do it with you\\nOh, thanks, but I think she\\'d feel like we\\'re gangin\\' up on her\\nNo, I mean you break up with Janice and I\\'ll break up with Tony\\nTony\\nOh, you\\'re breaking up with Tony\\nYeah, I know, he\\'s sweet, but it\\'s just not fun anymore, you know? I don\\'t know if it\\'s me, or his hunger strike, or, I don\\'t know\\n(waitressing) Does anybody want anything else\\nOh, yeah, last week you had a wonderful, nutty, chocolatey kind of a cakey pie thing. (Rachel gives him a dirty look) Nothing, just, just, I\\'m fine\\n(to Rachel) What\\'s the matter? Why so scrunchy\\nIt\\'s my father. He wants to give me a Mercedes convertible\\nThat guy, he burns me up\\nYeah, well, it\\'s a Mercedes if I move back home. Oh, it was horrible. He called me young lady\\nOoh, I hate when my father calls me that\\nDid he give you that whole \"You\\'re-not-up-to-this\" thing again\\nOh, yeah, yeah. Actually, I got the extended disco version, with three choruses of \"You\\'ll never make it on your own\"\\n(rhythmically) Uh-huh, uh-huh\\nHi, Joey\\nMy god, Angela\\nWow, being dumped by you obviously agrees with her\\nAre you gonna go over there\\nNo, yeah, no, ok, but not yet. I don\\'t wanna seem too eager. One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi. That seems pretty cool. (he walks over to her) Hey, Angela\\n(casually) Joey\\nYou look good\\nThat\\'s because I\\'m wearing a dress that accents my boobs\\nYou don\\'t say\\nSo, uh, Rachel, what are you, uh, what\\'re you doing tonight\\nOh, big glamour night. Me and Monica at Laundorama\\nOh, you uh, you wanna hear a freaky coincidence? Guess who\\'s doing laundry there too\\nWho\\nMe. Was that not clear? Hey, why don\\'t, um, why don\\'t I just join you both, here\\nDon\\'t you have a laundry room in your building\\nYes, I do have a laundry room in my building, um, but there\\'s a.... rat problem. Apparently they\\'re attracted to the dryer sheets, and they\\'re goin\\' in fine, but they\\'re comin\\' out all.... fluffy. Anyway, say, sevenish\\nSure\\nForget it Joey. I\\'m with Bob now\\nBob? Who the hell\\'s Bob\\nBob is great. He\\'s smart, he\\'s sophisticated, and he has a real job. You, you go on three auditions a month and you call yourself an actor, but Bob..\\nCome on, we were great together. And not just at the fun stuff, but like, talking too\\nYeah, well, sorry, Joe. You said let\\'s just be friends, so guess what\\nWhat\\nWe\\'re just friends\\nFine, fine, so, why don\\'t the four of us go out and have dinner together tonight? You know, as friends\\nWhat four of us\\nYou know, you and Bob, and me and my girlfriend, uh, uh, Monica\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s apartment, Joey is there, trying to convince Monica to pose as his girlfriend. His plan is to hook Monica up with Angela\\'s boyfriend Bob and then take Angela back for himself\\nMonica, I\\'m tellin\\' you, this guy is perfect for you\\nForget it. Not after your cousin who could belch the alphabet\\nCome on. This guy\\'s great. His name\\'s Bob. He\\'s Angela\\'s... brother. He\\'s smart, he\\'s sophisticated, and he has a real job. Me, I go on three auditions a month and call myself an actor, but Bob is..\\n(looking out window) Oh, god help us\\nWhat\\nUgly Naked Guy\\'s laying kitchen tile. Eww\\nEww! Look, I\\'m asking a favor here. If I do this for her brother, maybe Angela will come back to me\\nWhat\\'s going on here? You go out with tons of girls\\n(proud) I know, but, I made a huge mistake. I never should have broken up with her. Will you help me? Please\\nRoss\\' apartment, Chandler is over\\n(on phone) Ok, bye. (hangs up) Well, Monica\\'s not coming, it\\'s just gonna be me and Rachel\\nOh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you\\'ve thought this thing through\\nIt\\'s laundry. The thinking through is minimal\\nIt\\'s just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You\\'re going on a date\\nNuh-uh\\nYuh-huh\\nSo what\\'re you saying here? I should shave again, pick up some wine, what\\nWell, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear. This is basically the first time she\\'s gonna see your underwearÑyou want it to be dirty\\n(sheepish) No\\nOh, and uh, the fabric softener\\nOk, ok, now what is wrong with my Snuggles? What, it says I\\'m a sensitive, warm kinda guy, you know, like a warm, fuzzy bear. Ok, I can pick something else up on the way\\nThere you go\\nA fancy restaurant, Joey and Monica are there, meeting Angela and Bob, who Monica thinks is Angela\\'s brother\\nThank you. So what does this Bob guy look like? Is he tall? Short\\nYep\\nWhich\\nWhich what\\nYou\\'ve never met Bob, have you\\nNo, but he\\'s..\\nOh my god, Joey, for all we know this guy could be horribly..\\nHey, Joey\\n...horribly attractive. I\\'ll be shutting up now\\nCentral Perk, Chandler and Phoebe are there, both ready to break up with their significant others\\nWhere are they? Where are they\\nThis is nice. We never do anything just the two of us\\nIt\\'s great. Maybe tomorrow we can rent a car and run over some puppies\\nEww, I don\\'t wanna do that\\nHere we go\\nOk, have a good break-up\\nHey, Janice\\nOh, my god, I am so glad you called me. I had the most supremely awful day\\nHey, that\\'s not good. Can I get an espresso and a latte over here, please\\nWe got the proofs back from that photo shoot, you know, the one with the little vegetables. Anyway, they pretty much sucked, so, I blew off the rest of the day, and I went shopping...(looks through her bags)... and I got you, I\\'m looking, I\\'m looking, I\\'m looking, I got you..\\nWhat\\nWhat\\n(covering) What... did you get me there\\nI got you...these\\nBullwinkle socks. That\\'s so sweet\\nWell, I knew you had the Rockys, and so I figured, you know, you can wear Bullwinkle and Bullwinkle, or you can wear Rocky and Rocky,or, you can mix and match, moose and squirrel. Whatever you want\\nThat\\'s great\\nWell, I\\'m gonna get another espresso. Can I get you another latte\\n(holding the full cup) No, no, I\\'m still working on mine\\nThat\\'s it\\nYeah, it was really hard\\nOh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal\\nOk, you weren\\'t there\\nThe Launderama, Rachel is there, waiting for Ross. An old woman takes Rachel\\'s clothes off the machine and begins loading it with her things\\nComin\\' through. Move, move\\nOh, \\'scuse me. I was kinda using that machine\\nYeah, well, now you\\'re kinda not\\nBut I saved it. I put my basket on top\\nOh, I\\'m sorry, is that your basket? It\\'s really pretty. Unfortunately, I don\\'t see suds\\nWhat\\nNo suds, no save. Ok\\nWhat\\'s goin\\' on\\nHi, uh, nothing. That horrible woman just took my machine\\nWas your basket on top\\nYeah, but, there were no suds\\nSo\\nWell, you know, no suds, no save\\nNo suds? Excuse me, hold on a second. (to woman) That\\'s my friend\\'s machine\\nHey, hey, hey, her stuff wasn\\'t in it\\nHey, hey, hey, that\\'s not the rule and you know it\\n(to the crowd in the laundromat) All right, show\\'s over. Nothing to see here. (to Rachel) Ok, let\\'s do laundry\\nThat was amazing. I can\\'t even send back soup\\nWell, that\\'s because you\\'re such a sweet, gentle, uh...Do you, uh, do you...Oh, hey, uh you must need detergent\\nWhat\\'s that\\nUberveiss. It\\'s new, it\\'s German, it\\'s extra-tough\\nRach, do you uh, are you gonna separate those\\nOh god. Oh, am I being like a total laundry spaz? I mean, am I supposed to use like one machine for shirts and another machine for pants\\nRach, have you never done this before\\nWell, not myself, but I know other people that have. Ok, you caught me. I\\'m a laundry virgin\\nUh, well, don\\'t worry, I\\'ll use the gentle cycle. Ok, um, basically you wanna use one machine for all your whites, a whole nother machine for colors, and a third for your uh, your uh, delicates, and that would be your bras and your under-panty things\\n(holds a pair of panties in front of Ross) Ok, Well, what about these are white cotton panties. Would they go with whites or delicates\\n(visibly nervous) Uh, that, that, that would be a judgment call\\nFancy restaurant, Monica, Joey, Angela, and Bob are seated at the table\\n(to Joey) He is so cute. (to Angela and Bob) So, where did you guys grow up\\nBrooklyn Heights\\nCleveland\\nHow, how did that happen\\nOh my god\\nWhat\\nI suddenly had the feeling that I was falling. But I\\'m not\\nFancy restaurant, Joey and Bob are talking\\nSo, you and Angela, huh\\nYep. Pretty much\\nYou\\'re a lucky man. You know what I miss the most about her? That cute nibbly noise when she eats. Like a happy little squirrel, or a weasel\\nHuh, I never really noticed\\nOh, yeah, yeah, listen for it\\nMonica, Monica is great\\nYeah, but it\\'s not gonna last. She\\'s too much for me in bed. Sexually\\nThe ladies\\' bathroom at the restaurant, Monica and Angela are talking\\nI\\'ve gotta tell you, Bob is terrific\\nYeah, isn\\'t he\\nIt is so great to meet a guy who is smart and funny, and has an emotional age beyond, like eight\\nYou know what else? He\\'s unbelievable in bed\\nWow. My brother never even told me when he lost his virginity\\nHuh. That\\'s nice\\nCentral Perk, Phoebe is coaching Chandler on how to break up with Janice\\nOk, you can do this. It\\'s just like pulling off a Band-aid. Just do it really fast, and then the wound is exposed\\nJanice. Hi, Janice. Ok, here we go. I don\\'t think we should go out anymore. Janice\\nAll right. Well, there you go. (she gets extremely wound up, and begins to try and calm herself down) Stop it, stop it, stop it\\nThe laundromat\\nOk, I know this is gonna sound really stupid, but I feel that if I can do this, you know, if I can actually do my own laundry, there isn\\'t anything I can\\'t do\\nThat does not sound stupid to me. You know, it\\'s like the first time I had to make dinner for myself, after Carol left me? (the buzzer on the washer goes off) I\\'m sorry, that\\'s all the time we have. Next on Ross...(opens up the washer) Uh-oh\\nWhat uh-oh\\n(not wanting to tell her) Uh-oh, uh-oh, the laundry\\'s done. It\\'s, uh, it\\'s a song. The laundry song that we sing. (singing) Uh-oh the laundry\\'s done, uh-oh, uh-oh\\nRoss, what\\'s the matter\\nNothing, nothing. Lee-lo, the laundry\\'s done\\nCome on, show me\\nAll right, all right, it\\'s just that you left a red sock in with all your whites, and now, everything\\'s kinda pink\\nOh, everything\\'s pink\\nYeah, uh, except for the red sock, which is still red. I\\'m sorry, please don\\'t be upset, it could happen to anyone\\nExcept it didn\\'t. It happened to me. Oh, god, I\\'m gonna look like a big marshmallow peep. What am I doing? What am I doing? My father\\'s right. I can\\'t live on my own! I can\\'t even do laundry\\nThe fancy restaurant, Angela has her hand in Bob\\'s shirt, and Monica is very uncomfortable\\nSomething went wrong with Underdog, and they couldn\\'t get his head to inflate. So anyway, um, his head is like flopping down Broadway, right, and I\\'m just thinking... how inappropriate this is. Um, I\\'ve got something in my eye, uh, Joey, could we check it in the light, please\\nOh my god\\nWhat\\nHello! Were we at the same table?

How was your date, \\'Chand-lrr\\'\\nIt was unbelievable. I-I\\'ve never met anyone like her. She\\'s had the most amazing life! She was in the Israeli army..\\n...Luckily none of the bullets hit the engine block. So, we made it to the border, but just barely, and I- ...I\\'ve been talking about myself all night long, I\\'m sorry. What about you? Tell me one of your stories\\nAlright. Once I got on the subway, right, and it was at night, and I rode it all the way to Brooklyn... just for the hell of it\\nWe talked \\'til like two.

How could you get involved with a woman like this\\nWell, y\\'know, I had some trouble with it at first too, but the way I look at it is, I get all the good stuff: all the fun, all the talking, all the sex; and none of the responsibility. I mean, this is every guy\\'s fantasy\\nOh, yeah. That is not true. Ross, is this your fantasy\\nNo, of course not! (Thinks) ...Yeah, yeah, it is\\nWhat? So you guys don\\'t mind going out with someone else who\\'s going out with someone else\\nI couldn\\'t do it\\nGood for you, Joey\\nWhen I\\'m with a woman, I need to know that I\\'m going out with more people than she is\\nWell, y\\'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept\\nFine.

And we\\'re not supposed to ask\\nWell, whaddya think\\nVery clean! It looks great! Terrific\\n...Oh! I-I see you moved the green ottoman\\nUh-oh..\\nHow-how did that happen\\nI dunno.. I-I thought it looked better there. And I- and also, it\\'s an extra seat around the coffee table\\nYeah, yeah, it\\'s interesting.. but y\\'know what? Just for fun, let\\'s see what it looked like in the old spot. (She moves it.) Alright, just to compare. Let\\'s see. Well, it looks good there too. Let\\'s just leave it there for a while\\n(to Rachel) I can\\'t believe you tried to move the green ottoman\\nThank God you didn\\'t try to fan out the magazines. I mean, she\\'ll scratch your eyes right out\\nYou guys, I am not that bad\\nYeah, you are, Monica. Remember when I lived with you? You were like, a little, y\\'know, (psycho) Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree\\nThat is so unfair\\nOh c\\'mon! When we were kids, yours was the only Raggedy Ann doll that wasn\\'t raggedy\\nOkay, so I\\'m responsible, I\\'m organised. But hey, I can be a kook\\nAlright, you madcap gal. Try to imagine this. The phone bill arrives, but you don\\'t pay it right away\\nWhy not\\nBecause you\\'re a kook! Instead you wait until they send you a notice\\nI could do that\\nOkay, uh, you let me go grocery shopping, and I buy laundry detergent, but it\\'s not the one with the easy-pour spout\\nWhy would someone do that?! ...One might wonder\\nSomeone\\'s left a glass on the coffee table.

Y\\'know in a relationship you have these key moments that you know you\\'ll remember for the rest of your life? Well, every- single- second is like that with Aurora.. and I\\'ve just wasted about thirty-five of them talking to you people, so, uh.. Monica, can you help me with the door?

Get out\\nSo... which one of the two guys will you listen to\\nI don\\'t know, I-I have to listen to both of them, they don\\'t exactly let each other finish..\\nWhich one\\n...The second guy\\n(gets up to leave) Well, call me if you change your mind\\nSorry, the first guy runs the lips\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, Ross is trying to comfort Chandler.Ê Joey is absent\\nLook at it this way: you dumped her.

But you know, I\\'ll tell you something. Passion is way overrated\\nYeah right\\nIt is. Eventually, it kind of... burns out. But hopefully, what you\\'re left with is trust, and security, and... well, in the case of my ex-wife, lesbianism.

For a while now, I\\'ve been wanting to, um...\\nOhhh!!!\\nYes, yes, that\\'s right..\\nOh, look at the little cat\\nWhat? (the cat jumps on his shoulders) Ow\\n(singing) I\\'m on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find, is the wonders I\\'ve found ever since..\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, Phoebe is holding the cat, Monica is treating the scratches on Ross\\' back. Joey is holding the menorah over the wound\\n(to Ross) This is just Bactine. It won\\'t hurt\\nSorry, that was wax\\nOh, poor little Tooty is scared to death. We should find his owner\\nWhy don\\'t we just put \\'poor little Tooty\\' out in the hall\\nDuring a blackout? He\\'d get trampled\\n(nonchalantly) Yeah\\nATM vestibule\\nYou know, on second thought, gum would be perfection. (Jill gives him a stick of gum, and a strange look) \\'Gum would be perfection\\'? \\'Gum would be perfection.\\' Could have said \\'gum would be nice,\\' or \\'I\\'ll have a stick,\\' but no, no, no, no. For me, gum is perfection. I loathe myself\\nThe hallway of Monica\\'s building. Phoebe and Rachel are trying to find the cat\\'s owner\\n(stops at a door) Oh no, the Mendels, they hate all living things, right\\nOh. (they knock at the next door, Mr. Heckles answers) Hi. We just found this cat and we\\'re looking for the owner\\nEr, yeah, it\\'s mine\\n(trying to hold back the struggling cat) He seems to hate you. Are you sure\\nYeah, it\\'s my cat. Give me my cat\\nWait a minute. What\\'s his name\\nEhhhh... B-Buttons\\nBob Buttons\\nMmm. Bob Buttons. Here, Bob Buttons\\n(the cat runs away from her) Oooh! You are a very bad man\\n(as Phoebe and Rachel leave) You owe me a cat\\nRachel has gone off on her own to look for the cat\\'s owner\\nHere, kitty-kitty. Here kitty-kitty. Where did you go, little kitty-kitty-kitty? Here kitty-kitty-kitty-kitty..\\nWow\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, Ross, Monica, and Joey are playing Monopoly\\n(rolling) Lucky sixes...\\n(entering with Paolo, arm in arm) Everybody, this is Paolo.

This is Monica\\n(smitten) Hi\\nAnd Joey...\\nHi\\nAnd Ross\\nHi\\n(proudly) He doesn\\'t speak much English\\n(pointing at game) Monopoly\\nLook at that\\n(jealous) So, um... where did Paolo come from\\nOh... Italy, I think\\nNo, I mean tonight, in the building. Suddenly. Into our lives\\nWell, the cat... the cat turned out to be Paolo\\'s cat\\nThat, that is funny... (to Joey).... and Rachel keeps touching him\\nAlright. I looked all over the building and I couldn\\'t find the kitty anywhere\\nOh, I found him. He was Paolo\\'s cat\\nAh! Well! There you go! Last to know again! And I\\'m guessing... since nobody told me... this is Paolo\\nAh, Paolo, this is Phoebe\\n(smiling) You betcha\\nATM vestibule\\n(chewing gum) Ah, let\\'s see. What next? Blow a bubble. A bubble\\'s good. It\\'s got a... boyish charm, it\\'s impish. Here we go\\nNice going, imp. OK, it\\'s OK. All I need to do is reach over and put it in my mouth. (Chandler slyly grabs the gum from the wall and slides it back in his mouth\\nGood save! We\\'re back on track, and I\\'m... (grimacing) ..chewing someone else\\'s gum. This is not my gum. Oh my God! Oh my God! And now you\\'re choking\\nAre you alright\\nMy God, you\\'re choking! (she runs over and gives him the Heimlich, the gum flies from his mouth) That better\\n(gasping) Yes... thank you. That was... that was...\\nPerfection\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, Rachel and Paolo are at the window.

What am I doing? This is so un-me\\nIf you want, I\\'ll do it\\nI know, I just want to bite his bottom lip. (Rachel looks at her) But I won\\'t\\nGod, the first time he smiled at me... those three seconds were more exciting than three weeks in Bermuda with Barry\\nYou know, did you ride mopeds? \\'Cause I\\'ve heard... (they stare at her)... oh, I see... it\\'s not about that right now. OK\\nY\\'know, I know it\\'s totally superficial and we have absolutely nothing in common, and we don\\'t even speak the same language but Goooooooddddddd...\\nPaolo. Hi\\nRoss\\nListen. Um, listen. Something you should... know... um, Rachel and I... we\\'re kind of a thing\\nThing\\nThing, yes. Thing\\nAh, you... have the sex\\nNo, no, no. Technically the... sex is not... being had, but that\\'s... see, that\\'s not the point. See, um, the point is that... Rachel and I should be, er, together. You know, and if you get in the.... um..\\nBed\\nNo, no, that\\'s not where I was going. Er, if you get in the... way, of us becoming a thing, then I would be, well, very sad\\nOh\\nYeah! Se vice\\nSi\\nSo you do know a little English\\nPoco... a leetle\\nDo you know the word crapweasel\\nNo\\nThat\\'s funny, because you know, you are a huge crapweasel\\nATM vestibule, Chandler and Jill are sitting below the counter with two pens dangling from their chains in front of them.

Now watch, it\\'s easy\\nOK\\nReady\\nNo, you\\'ve got to whip it\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, the gang is all sitting around the table\\nOh, look look look.

Mwwwooooo-hah-hah..\\nOh.. oh... oh\\nHey Ross. This probably isn\\'t the best time to bring it up, but you have to throw a party for Monica\\nATM vestibule, the power has come back on\\nWell, this has been fun\\nYes. Yes, thanks for letting me use your phone... and for saving my life\\nWell, goodbye Chandler. I had a great blackout. (she kisses him on the cheek) See ya\\nHi, um, I\\'m account number 7143457. And, uh, I don\\'t know if you got any of that, but I would really like a copy of the tape\\nChandler\\'s Office, Chandler is on a coffee break. Ê Shelley enters\\nHey gorgeous, how\\'s it going\\nDehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights... does it get better than this\\nQuestion. You\\'re not dating anybody, are you, because I met somebody who would be perfect for you\\nAh, y\\'see, perfect might be a problem. Had you said \\'co-dependent\\', or \\'self-destructive\\'..\\nDo you want a date Saturday\\nYes please\\nOkay\\nHe\\'s a he\\nWell yeah! ...Oh God. I- just- I thought- Good, Shelley. I\\'m just gonna go flush myself down the toilet now...(backs out of the room) Okay, goodbye..\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, everyone is there\\n...Couldn\\'t enjoy a cup of noodles after that. I mean, is that ridiculous? Can you believe she actually thought that\\nUm... yeah. Well, I mean, when I first met you, y\\'know, I thought maybe, possibly, you might be..\\nYou did\\nYeah, but then you spent Phoebe\\'s entire birthday party talking to my breasts, so then I figured maybe not\\nHuh. Did, uh... any of the rest of you guys think that when you first met me\\nI did\\nYeah, I think so, yeah\\nNot me\\nNono, me neither. Although, uh, y\\'know, back in college, Susan Sallidor did\\nYou\\'re kidding! Did you tell her I wasn\\'t\\nNo. No, it\\'s just \\'cause, uh, I kinda wanted to go out with her too, so I told her, actually, you were seeing Bernie Spellman... who also liked her, so..\\nWell, this is fascinating. So, uh, what is it about me\\nI dunno, \\'cause you\\'re smart, you\\'re funny..\\nRoss is smart and funny, d\\'you ever think that about him\\nYeah! Right\\nWHAT IS IT?\\nOkay, I-I d\\'know, you-you just- you have a quality\\nYes. Absolutely. A quality\\nOh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this\\nHello? Hello? Oh! Rachel, it\\'s Paolo calling from Rome\\nOh my God! Calling from Rome! (Takes phone) Bon giorno, caro mio\\n(to Joey) So he\\'s calling from Rome. I could do that. Just gotta go to Rome\\nMonica, your dad just beeped in, but can you make it quick? Talking to Rome. (Showing off to Phoebe and Chandler) I\\'m talking to Rome\\nHey dad, what\\'s up? (Listens) Oh God. Ross, it\\'s Nana\\nThe Hospital, Mr. and Mrs. Geller are there, along with Aunt Lillian. Ross and Monica enter and everyone says hi and kisses\\nSo, uh, how\\'s she doing\\nThe doctor says it\\'s a matter of hours\\nHow-how are you, Mom\\nMe? I\\'m fine, fine. I\\'m glad you\\'re here. ...What\\'s with your hair\\nWhat\\nWhat\\'s different\\nNothing\\nOh, maybe that\\'s it\\nShe is unbelievable, our mother is..\\nOkay, relax, relax. We are gonna be here for a while, it looks like, and we still have boyfriends and your career to cover\\nOh God\\nThe fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse\\nOh! ...Yeah, they were gross. Oh, you know what I loved? Her Sweet \\'n\\' Los. How she was always stealing them from- from restaurants\\nNot just restaurants, from our house\\nMrs. Geller\\nShe looks so small\\nI know\\nWell, at least she\\'s with Pop-Pop and Aunt Phyllis now\\nG\\'bye, Nana. (She kisses her on the forehead\\nBye, Nana\\nRoss\\nWhat is going on?\\nY\\'know how-how the nurse said that-that Nana had passed? Well, she\\'s not, quite.\\nWhat\\nShe\\'s not- past, she\\'s present, she\\'s back\\n(reentering) What\\'s going on\\nShe may have died\\nShe may have died\\nWe\\'re looking into it\\nI, uh, I\\'ll go see\\nThis almost never happens\\nNow she\\'s passed\\nCentral Perk, Chandler, Phoebe, Joey, and Rachel are there\\nI just have to know, okay. Is it my hair\\n(exasperated) Yes, Chandler, that\\'s exactly what it is. It\\'s your hair\\nYeah, you have homosexual hair\\nSo, um, did she..\\nTwice\\nTwice\\nOh, that sucks\\nYou guys okay\\nI dunno, it\\'s weird. I mean, I know she\\'s gone, but I just don\\'t feel, uh..\\nMaybe that\\'s \\'cause she\\'s not really gone\\nNono, she\\'s gone\\nWe checked. A lot\\nHm, I mean maybe no-one ever really goes. Ever since my mom died, every now and then, I get the feeling that she\\'s like right here, y\\'know? (She circles her hand around her right shoulder. Chandler, sitting on her right, draws back nervously) Oh! And Debbie, my best friend from junior high- got struck by lightning on a miniature golf course- I always get this really strong Debbie vibe whenever I use one of those little yellow pencils, y\\'know? ...I miss her\\nAw. Hey, Pheebs, want this\\nThanks\\nSure. I just sharpened her this morning\\nNow, see, I don\\'t believe any of that. I think once you\\'re dead, you\\'re dead! You\\'re gone! You\\'re worm food! (realises his tactlessness) ...So Chandler looks gay, huh\\nY\\'know, I dunno who this is, but it\\'s not Debbie\\nNana\\'s house, Ross, Mrs. Geller and Aunt Lillian are going through clothes\\nI thought it was gonna be a closed casket\\nWell, that doesn\\'t mean she can\\'t look nice\\nSweetie, you think you can get in there\\n(sarcastic) I don\\'t see why not\\nHere\\'s my retainer\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, Monica is talking to her father\\nI was just thinking\\nDad\\nListen to me! When my time comes, I wanna be buried at sea\\nYou what\\nI wanna be buried at sea, it looks like fun\\nDefine fun\\nC\\'mon, you\\'ll make a day of it! You\\'ll rent a boat, pack a lunch..\\n...And then we throw your body in the water... Gee, that does sound fun\\nEveryone thinks they know me. Everyone says \\'Jack Geller, so predictable\\'. Maybe after I\\'m gone, they\\'ll say \\'Buried at sea! Huh!\\'\\nThat\\'s probably what they\\'ll say\\nI\\'d like that\\nChandler\\'s Office, Shelley is drinking coffee; Chandler enters\\nHey, gorgeous\\n(sheepish) Hey\\nNo, nono, don\\'t- don\\'t worry about it. Believe me, apparently other people have made the same mistake\\nOh! Okay! Phew\\nSo, uh... what do you think it is about me\\nI dunno, uh... you just have a-a..\\n...Quality, right, great\\nY\\'know, it\\'s a shame, because you and Lowell would\\'ve made a great couple\\nLowell? Financial Services\\' Lowell, that\\'s who you saw me with\\nWhat? He\\'s cute\\nWell, yeah... \\'s\\'no Brian in Payroll\\nIs Brian...\\nNo! Uh, I d\\'know! The point is, if you were gonna set me up with someone, I\\'d like to think you\\'d set me up with someone like him\\nWell, I think Brian\\'s a little out of your league\\nExcuse me? You don\\'t think I could get a Brian? Because I could get a Brian. Believe you me. ...I\\'m really not\\nNana\\'s Bedroom, Ross is holding a dress out from inside the closet\\n(holding a dress out from inside the closet) This one\\nNo\\nI have shown you everything we have. Unless you want your mother to spend eternity in a lemon yellow pant-suit, go with the burgundy\\nYou know, whatever we pick, she would\\'ve told us it\\'s the wrong one\\nYou\\'re right. We\\'ll go with the burgundy\\nOh! A fine choice. I\\'m coming out\\nWait! We need shoes\\nOkay. Um, how about these\\nThat\\'s really a day shoe\\nAnd where she\\'s going everyone else\\'ll be dressier\\nCould we see something in a slimmer heel\\n(forages around) Okay, I have nothing in an evening shoe in the burgundy. I can show you something in a silver that may work\\nNo, it really should be burgundy\\nMm. Unless we go with a different dress\\nNo! Nonono, wait a sec. I may have something in the back\\nOh my God.\\nIs everything all right, dear\\nYeah, just... just Nana stuff\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, Monica and Rachel are preparing to leave for the funeral\\n(entering) How we doing, you guys ready\\nMom already called this morning to remind me not to wear my hair up. Did you know my ears are not my best feature\\nSome days it\\'s all I can think about\\n(entering) Hi, sorry I\\'m late, I couldn\\'t find my bearings\\nOh, you-you mean your earrings\\nWhat\\'d I say\\n(sticking her foot out) Hm-m\\nAre these the shoes\\nYes. Paolo sent them from Italy\\nWhat, we-uh- we don\\'t have shoes here, or...\\n(entering with Chandler) Morning. We ready to go\\nWell, don\\'t we look nice all dressed up?...It\\'s stuff like that, isn\\'t it\\nThe cemetary, after the funeral\\nIt was a really beautiful service\\nIt really was. Oh, c\\'mere, sweetheart. (Hugs her) Y\\'know, I think it might be time for you to start using night cream\\nWhat\\nNothing, just your overcoat sounds remarkably like Brent Mussberger\\nCheck it out, Giants-Cowboys\\nYou\\'re watching a football game at a funeral\\nNo, it\\'s the pre-game. I\\'m gonna watch it at the reception\\nYou are a frightening, frightening man\\nOh no! My new Paolo shoes\\nOh, I hope they\\'re not ruined\\nGod, what a great day. ...What? Weather-wise\\nI know, uh, the air, the-the trees..\\nGod! Ross\\nI\\'m fine. Just-just... having my worst fear realised..\\nThe Wake, at the Gellers\\' house. Ross is lying on his back, with Phoebe squatting over him, checking to see if he\\'s injured\\nOkay, don\\'t worry, I\\'m just checking to see if the muscle\\'s in spasm...huh\\nWhat, what is it\\nYou missed a belt loop\\nOh\\nOkay, it\\'s in spasm\\nHere, sweetie, here. I took these when I had my golfing accident. (Hands Ross a bottle of pills\\nSorry- Hi, I\\'m Dorothy\\'s daughter\\nHi, I\\'m Chandler, and I have no idea who Dorothy is\\nHey, look who\\'s up! How do you feel\\nI feel great. I feel- great, I fleel great\\nWow, those pills really worked, huh\\nNot the first two, but the second two- woooo! ...I love you guys. You guys are the greatest. I love my sister (Kisses Monica), I love Pheebs..\\nOoh! That\\'s so nice..\\n...Chandler\\nHey\\n(hugs him) And listen, man, if you wanna be gay, be gay. Doesn\\'t matter to me\\n(turns to a friend) You were right. (They walk off and leave Chandler\\nRachel. Rachel Rachel. (Sits down beside her) I love you the most\\n(humouring him) Oh, well you know who I love the most\\nNo\\nYou\\nOh.. you don\\'t get it\\nWhaddya got there\\n(hides the TV, but he still has an earphone) Just a, uh... hearing disability\\nWhat\\'s the score\\nSeventeen-fourteen Giants... three minutes to go in the third\\nBeautiful\\n(still trapped under Ross) Pheebs, could you maybe hand me a cracker\\n(to Monica) Your grandmother would have hated this\\nWell, sure, what with it being her funeral and all\\nNo, I\\'d be hearing about \\'Why didn\\'t I get the honey-glazed ham?\\', I didn\\'t spend enough on flowers, and if I spent more she\\'d be saying \\'Why are you wasting your money? I don\\'t need flowers, I\\'m dead\\'\\nThat sounds like Nana\\nDo you know what it\\'s like to grow up with someone who is critical of every single thing you say\\n...I can imagine\\nI\\'m telling you, it\\'s a wonder your mother turned out to be the positive, life-affirming person that she is\\nThat is a wonder. So tell me something, Mom. If you had to do it all over again, I mean, if she was here right now, would you tell her\\nTell her what\\nHow she drove you crazy, picking on every little detail, like your hair... for example\\nI\\'m not sure I know what you\\'re getting at\\nDo you think things would have been better if you\\'d just told her the truth\\n...No. I think some things are better left unsaid. I think it\\'s nicer when people just get along\\nHuh\\nMore wine, dear\\nOh, I think so\\n(reaches out to fiddle with Monica\\'s hair again, and realises) Those earrings look really lovely on you\\nThank you. They\\'re yours\\nActually they were Nana\\'s\\nNow I\\'m depressed! ...(To everyone) Even more than I was\\nCentral Perk, the gang are looking at old photos\\nHey, who\\'s this little naked guy\\nThat little naked guy would be me\\nAww, look at the little thing\\nYes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now\\nWho are those people\\nGot me\\nOh, that\\'s Nana, right there in the middle. (Reads the back) \\'Me and the gang at Java Joe\\'s\\'\\nWow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother.

I\\'m, uh, just trying something\\nChandler\\'s Office, Chandler is on a coffee break as Lowell enters\\nHey, Lowell\\nHey, Chandler\\nSo how\\'s it going there in Financial Services\\nIt\\'s like Mardi Gras without the paper mache heads. How \\'bout you\\nGood, good. Listen, heh, I dunno what Shelley told you about me, but, uh... I\\'m not\\nI know. That\\'s what I told her\\nReally\\nYeah\\nSo- you can tell\\nPretty much, most of the time. We have a kind of... radar\\nSo you don\\'t think I have a, a quality\\nSpeaking for my people, I\\'d have to say no. By the way, your friend Brian from Payroll, he is\\nHe is\\nYup, and waaay out of your league\\nOut of my league. I could get a Brian. (Brian enters behind him) If I wanted to get a Brian, I could get a Brian. (Sees him) Hey, Brian\\nCentral Perk, Rachel is confronting her boss, Terry\\nTerry, I, I, I know that I haven\\'t worked here very long, but I was wondering, do you think it would be possible if I got a $100 advance in my salary\\nAn advance\\nIt\\'s so that I can spend Thanksgiving with my family. See, every year we go skiing in Vail, and normally my father pays for my ticket, but I sort of started the whole independence thing, you know, which is actually why I took this job\\nRachel, Rachel, sweetheart. You\\'re a terrible, terrible waitress. Really, really awful\\nOk, I, I hear what you\\'re sayin\\'. I\\'m with you. Um, but I, but I\\'m trying really hard. And I think I\\'m doing better. I really do. Does anybody need coffee? (everyone in the place raises their hand) Oh, look at that\\nCentral Perk, Rachel is approaching a customer\\nExcuse me, sir. Hi, you come in here all time. I was just wondering, do you think there\\'s a possibility that you could give me an advance on my tips\\nHuh\\nOk, ok, that\\'s fine. Fine. Hey, I\\'m sorry about that spill before. (picks up the tip he leaves) Only $98.50 to go\\nHey. Ross, did you know Mom and Dad are going to Puerto Rico for Thanksgiving\\nNo, they\\'re not\\nYes, they are. The Blymens invited them\\nYou\\'re wrong\\nI am not wrong\\nYou\\'re wrong\\nNo, I just talked to them\\n(getting up, upset) I\\'m calling Mom\\nHey, hey\\nHey\\nHey\\nAnd this from the cry-for-help department. Are you wearing makeup\\nYes, I am. As of today, I am officially Joey Tribbiani, actor slash model\\nThat\\'s so funny, \\'cause I was thinking you look more like Joey Tribbiani, man slash woman\\nWhat were you modeling for\\nYou know those posters for the city free clinic\\nOh, wow, so you\\'re gonna be one of those \"healthy, healthy, healthy guys\"\\nYou know, the asthma guy was really cute\\nDo you know which one you\\'re gonna be\\nNo, but I hear lyme disease is open, so..\\nGood luck, man. I hope you get it\\nThanks\\n(to Monica) Well, you were right. How can they do this to us, huh? It\\'s Thanksgiving\\nOk, I\\'ll tell you what. How about I cook dinner at my place? I\\'ll make it just like Mom\\'s\\nWill you make the mashed potatoes with the lumps\\nYou know, they\\'re not actually supposed to have... (Ross looks at her sheepishly) I\\'ll work on the lumps. Joey, you\\'re going home, right\\nYeah\\nAnd I assume, Chandler, you are still boycotting all the pilgrim holidays\\nYes, every single one of them\\nPhoebe, you\\'re gonna be with your grandma\\nYes, and her boyfriend. But we\\'re celebrating Thanksgiving in December \\'cause he is lunar\\nSo you\\'re free Thursday, then\\nYeah. Oh, can I come\\nYeah. Rach, are you thinking you\\'re gonna make it to Vail\\nAbsolutely. Shoop, shoop, shoop. Only a hundred and two dollars to go\\nI thought it was $98.50\\nYeah, well it was. I, I broke a cup\\nWell, I\\'m off to Carol\\'s\\nOoh, ooh! Why don\\'t we invite her\\n(mimicking) Ooh, ooh. Because she\\'s my ex-wife, and will probably want to bring her, ooh, ooh, lesbian life partner\\nCarol and Susan\\'s apartment, Susan is there. Ross enters\\nHi, is uh, is Carol here\\nNo, she\\'s at a faculty meeting\\nOh, I uh, just came by to pick up my skull. Well, not mine, but...Susan: Come in\\nThanks. Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to get it back to the museum\\nWhat\\'s it look like\\nKinda like a big face without skin\\nYes, I\\'m familiar with the concept. We can just look for it\\nOk. (browsing the apartment) Wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about bein\\' a lesbian\\nWell, you know, you have to take a course. Otherwise, they don\\'t let you do it\\n(picking up a book) Hey, hey, Yertle the Turtle. A classic\\nActually, I\\'m reading it to the baby\\nThe uh, the baby that hasn\\'t been born yet? Wouldn\\'t that mean you\\'re... crazy\\nWhat, you don\\'t think they can hear sounds in there\\nYou\\'re not serious, I mean, you really... you really talk to it\\nYeah, all the time. I want the baby to know my voice\\nDo you uh, do you talk about me\\nYeah, yeah, all the time\\nReally\\nBut um, we just refer to you as Bobo the Sperm Guy\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, everyone is there but Rachel\\nLook, if she\\'s talking to it, I just think that I should get some belly time too. Not that I believe any of this\\nOh, I believe it. I think the baby can totally hear everything. I can show you. Look, this will seem a little weird, but you put your head inside this turkey, and then we\\'ll all talk, and you\\'ll hear everything we say\\nI\\'d just like to say that I\\'m totally behind this experiment. In fact, I\\'d very much like to butter your head\\nHey, Rach, did you make your money\\nNo, not even close. Forget Vail, forget seeing my family, forget shoop, shoop, shoop\\nRach, here\\'s your mail\\nThanks, you can just put it on the table\\n(insistently) No, here\\'s your mail\\nThanks, you can just put it on the table\\n(gives her an envelope) Would you just open it\\nOh my god, oh, you guys are great\\nWe all chipped in\\n(to Monica) We did\\n(to Joey) You owe me 20 bucks\\nThank you. Thank you so much\\n(hands Chandler a bag) Chandler, here you go, got your traditional Thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin\\'s, and your family size bag of Funyuns\\nWait, wait, Chandler, this is what you\\'re havin\\' for Thanksgiving dinner? What, what, what is it with you and this holiday\\nAll right, I\\'m nine years old\\nOh, I hate this story\\nWe just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner. I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they\\'re getting divorced\\nOh my god\\nYes. It\\'s very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you\\'ve seen it in reverse\\nThe subway, Joey spots a gorgeous woman waiting. He goes up to her\\nUh, hi. We uh, we used to work together\\nWe did\\nYeah, at Macy\\'s. You were the Obsession girl, right? I was the Aramis guy. (pretends to spray cologne) Aramis? Aramis\\nYeah, right\\nI gotta tell you. You\\'re the best in the business\\nGet out\\nI\\'m serious. You\\'re amazing. You know when to spritz, when to lay back\\nReally? You don\\'t know what that means to me\\nOoh, you smell great tonight. What\\'re you wearing\\n(provocatively) Nothing\\nListen, uh, you wanna go get a drink or something\\nYeah. (she gets up, notices something behind Joey) Oh\\nWhat\\'s wrong\\nI just remembered, I have to do something\\nOh. What\\nUm, leave\\nWait, wait, wait\\nWhat Mario isn\\'t telling you...V.D., you never know who might have it. A variety of scenes are shown with the poster displayed all over New York City\\nCentral Perk, Joey enters, amongst snickers from the gang\\nSo I guess you all saw it\\nSaw what\\nNo, we were just laughing. You know, how laughter can be infectious\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, Joey enters, upset\\nSet another place for Thanksgiving. My entire family thinks I have VD\\nTonight, on a very special Blossom\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, Monica is cooking Thanksgiving dinner. Chandler is standing in the doorway, not wanting to participate in the festivities\\nMmm, looking good. Ok, cider\\'s mulling, turkey\\'s turking, yams are yamming. (notices Ross is depressed) What\\nI don\\'t know. It\\'s just not the same without Mom in the kitchen\\nAll right, that\\'s it. You know what? Just get out of my way and stop moping\\nThat\\'s closer\\nI got the tickets! I got the tickets! Five hours from now, shoop, shoop, shoop\\nOh, you must stop shooping\\nOk, I\\'m gonna get my stuff\\nChandler, will you just come in already\\nNo, I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment\\nLook out, incoming pumpkin pie\\nOk, we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that\\'s not funny anymore\\nHey, Monica, I got a question. I don\\'t see any tater tots\\nThat\\'s not a question\\nBut my mom always makes them. It\\'s like a tradition. You get a little piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a tot! It\\'s bad enough I can\\'t be with my family because of my disease\\nAll right, fine. Tonight\\'s potatoes will be both mashed with lumps, and in the form of tots\\nOk, I\\'m off to talk to my unborn child\\nAh\\nOk, Mom never hit\\n(stirring pot) Ok, all done\\nWhat, Phoebe, did you whip the potatoes? Ross needs lumps\\nOh, I\\'m sorry, oh, I just, I thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions\\nWhy would we do that\\nWell, \\'cause then they\\'d be like my mom used to make them, you know, before she died\\nOk, three kinds of potatoes coming up\\nOk, good-bye you guys. Thanks for everything. (she starts to leave, and hits everyone with her skis) Oh, sorry! Oh, sorry\\nThe most unbelievable thing has happened. Underdog has just gotten away\\nThe balloon\\nNo, no, the actual cartoon character. Of course the balloon. It\\'s all over the news. Right before he reached Macy\\'s, he broke free and was spotted flying over Washington Square Park. I\\'m goin\\' to the roof, who\\'s with me\\nI can\\'t, I gotta go\\nCome on. An 80-foot inflatable dog let loose over the city. How often does that happen\\nAlmost never\\nGot the keys? or Got the keys\\nOk\\nCarol and Susan\\'s, Ross is preparing to talk to her belly\\nAnytime you\\'re ready\\nOk, ok, here we go. (he crouches down near her stomach) Ok, where am I talking to, here? I mean, uh, well, there is one way that seems to offer a certain acoustical advantage, but..\\nJust aim for the bump\\nOk, ok, ok, ok, here goes. You know, I, you know, can\\'t do this. Uh, this is too weird. I feel stupid\\nSo don\\'t do it, it\\'s fine. You don\\'t have to do it just because Susan does it\\n(quickly talking) Hello, baby. Hello, hello\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, the group is coming back from the roof\\nI loved the moment when you first saw the giant dog shadow all over the park\\nYeah, but did they have to shoot him down? I mean, that was just mean\\nOk, right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. Why are we standing here\\nWe\\'re waiting for you to open the door. You got the keys\\nNo I don\\'t\\nYes, you do. When we left, you said, \"got the keys\\nNo I didn\\'t. I asked, \"got the ke-eys\\nNo, no, no, you said, \"got the keys\"\\nDo either of you have the keys\\n(panicked) The oven is on\\nOh, I gotta get my ticket\\nWait, wait, we have a copy of your key\\nWell then get it, get it\\nThat tone will not make me go any faster\\n(angry) Joey\\nThat one will\\nCarol and Susan\\'s, Carol is reading, Ross is talking to her stomach\\nAnd everyone\\'s telling me, you gotta pick a major, you gotta pick a major. So, on a dare, I picked paleontology. And you have no idea what I\\'m saying, because, let\\'s face it, you\\'re a fetus. You\\'re just happy you don\\'t have gills anymore\\nLook, you don\\'t have to talk to it. You can sing to it if you want\\nOh, please. I am not singing to your stomach, ok\\nHi, how\\'s it goin\\nShh! (singing) Here we come, walkin\\' down the street, get the funniest looks from, everyone we meet. Hey, hey! (to Carol) Hey, uh, did you just feel that\\nI did\\nDoes it always, uh--\\nNo, no that was the first\\nKeep singing! Keep singing\\n(singing) Hey, hey, you\\'re my baby, and I can\\'t wait to meet you. When you come out I\\'ll buy you a bagel, and then we\\'ll go to the zoo\\nI felt it\\n(singin) Hey, hey, I\\'m your daddy. I\\'m the one without any breasts\\nThe Hallway, Joey has a tray full of keys, and is trying each one in the lock\\nNope, not that one\\nCan you go any faster with that\\nHey, I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys. You do the math\\nWhy do you guys have so many keys in there anyway\\n(sarcastic) For an emergency just like this\\n(grabs Chandler by the shirt) All right, listen, smirky. If it wasn\\'t for you and your stupid balloon, I would be on a plane watching a woman do this (makes a gesture like a stewardess pointing out exits) right now. But I\\'m not\\nI swear you said you had the keys\\nNo, I didn\\'t. I wouldn\\'t say I had the keys unless I had the keys, and I obviously didn\\'t have the keys\\nOoh, ok, that\\'s it. Enough with the keys. No one say keys\\nWhy would I have the keys\\nAside from the fact that you said you had them\\nBut I didn\\'t\\nWell, you should have\\nWhy\\nBecause\\nWhy\\nBecause\\nWhy? Because everything is my responsibility? Isn\\'t it enough that I\\'m making Thanksgiving dinner for everyone? You know, everyone wants a different kind of potatoes, so I\\'m making different kinds of potatoes. Does anybody care what kind of potatoes I want? Nooooo, no, no! (starting to cry) Just as long as Phoebe gets her peas and onions, and Mario gets his tots, and it\\'s my first Thanksgiving, and it\\'s all burned, and, and I... I..\\nOk, Monica, only dogs can hear you now, so, look, the door\\'s open. Here we go\\nWell, the turkey\\'s burnt. (checking pots) Potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined\\nHere we come, walkin\\' down theÑthis doesn\\'t smell like Mom\\'s\\nNo, it doesn\\'t, does it? But you wanted lumps, Ross? (picks up the pan of badly burnt potatoes) Well, here you go, buddy, ya got one\\nOh, god, this is great! The plane is gone, so it looks like I\\'m stuck here with you guys\\nHey, we all had better plans. This was nobody\\'s first choice\\nOh, really? So why was I busting my ass to make this delicious Thanksgiving dinner\\nYou call that delicious\\nStop it, stop it, stop it\\nNow this feels like Thanksgiving\\nOoh\\nWhat\\nUgly Naked Guy\\'s taking his turkey out of the oven. Oh my god. He\\'s not alone. Ugly Naked Guy\\'s having Thanksgiving dinner with Ugly Naked Gal\\nI\\'ve gotta see this. All right Ugly Naked Guy\\nOoh, Ugly Naked Dancing\\nIt\\'s nice that he has someone\\nShall I carve\\nBy all means\\nOk, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese\\nI don\\'t even wanna know about the dark cheese\\n(holding sandwich) Does anybody wanna split this with me\\nOh, I will\\nOoh, you guys have to make a wish\\nMake a wish\\nCome on, you know, Thanksgiving. Ooh, you got the bigger half. What\\'d you wish for\\nThe bigger half\\nI\\'d like to propose a toast. Little toast here, ding ding. I know this isn\\'t the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn\\'t involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you\\'d gone to Vail, and if you guys\\'d been with your family, if you didn\\'t have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn\\'t be all together, you know? So I guess what I\\'m trying to say is that I\\'m very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked\\nThat\\'s so sweet\\nAnd hey, here\\'s to a lousy Christmas\\nAnd a crappy New Year\\nHere, here\\nThe Subway, Joey sees his poster and he peels off the caption on his poster, revealing more posters underneath\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, Ross is entering\\nGuys? There\\'s a somebody I\\'d like you to meet\\nOooh\\nW-wait. What is that\\n\\'That\\' would be Marcel. You wanna say hi\\nNo, no, I don\\'t\\nOh, he is precious! Where did you get him\\nMy friend Bethel rescued him from some lab\\nThat is so cruel! Why? Why would a parent name their child Bethel\\nHey, that monkey\\'s got a Ross on its ass\\nRoss, is he gonna live with you, like, in your apartment\\nYeah. I mean, it\\'s been kinda quiet since Carol left, so..\\nWhy don\\'t you just get a roommate\\nNah, I dunno... I think you reach a certain age, having a roommate is kinda pathe- (Realises) ....sorry, that\\'s, that\\'s \\'pathet\\', which is Sanskrit for \\'really cool way to live\\'\\nCentral Perk, Phoebe is getting ready to sing. Joey is not there\\nSo you guys, I\\'m doing all new material tonight. I have twelve new songs about my mother\\'s suicide, and one about a snowman\\nMight wanna open with the snowman\\nHey, Joey. Hey, buddy\\nSo, how\\'d it go\\nAhhhhhh, I didn\\'t get the job\\nHow could you not get it? You were Santa last year\\nI dunno. Some fat guy\\'s sleeping with the store manager. He\\'s not even jolly, it\\'s all political\\nSo what are you gonna be\\nAh, I\\'m gonna be one of his helpers. It\\'s just such a slap in the face, y\\'know\\nHey, do you guys know what you\\'re doing for New Year\\'s? (They all protest and hit her with cushions) Gee, what?! What is wrong with New Year\\'s\\nNothing for you, you have Paolo. You don\\'t have to face the horrible pressures of this holiday: desperate scramble to find anything with lips just so you can have someone to kiss when the ball drops!! Man, I\\'m talking loud\\nWell, for your information, Paolo is gonna be in Rome this New Year, so I\\'ll be just as pathetic as the rest of you\\nYeah, you wish\\nIt\\'s just that I\\'m sick of being a victim of this Dick Clark holiday. I say this year, no dates, we make a pact. Just the six of us- dinner\\nYeah, okay. Alright\\nY\\'know, I was hoping for a little more enthusiasm\\nWoooo! Yeah\\nPhoebe, you\\'re on\\nOh, oh, good\\n(Into microphone) Okay, hi. Ladies and gentlemen, back by popular demand, Miss Phoebe Buffay. Wooh\\n(Takes mike) Thanks, hi. Um, I wanna start with a song that means a lot to me this time of year\\nNo. No, that\\'s- that\\'s okay\\nWell, c\\'mon, if it\\'s important enough to discuss while I\\'m playing, then I assume it\\'s important enough for everyone else to hear\\n(Quietly, to the others) That guy\\'s going home with a note\\nCould you speak up please\\n(Stands up and speaks more loudly) Sorry, I wa- I was just saying to my friend that I thought you were the most beautiful woman that I\\'d ever seen in my- in my life\\nDaryl Hannah\\nHard quality\\n-hard quality. And uh, while Daryl Hannah is beautiful in a conventional way, you are luminous with a kind of a delicate grace. Then, uh, that-that-that\\'s when you started yelling\\nOkay, we\\'re gonna take a short break\\nHey, that guy\\'s going home with more than a note\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, everyone except Joey is decorating for Christmas\\nCome here, Marcel. Sit here\\nPheebs, I can\\'t believe he hasn\\'t kissed you yet. I mean God, by my sixth date with Paolo, I mean he had already named both my breasts! ...Ooh. Did I just share too much\\nJust a smidge\\nDavid\\'s like, y\\'know, Scientist Guy. He\\'s very methodical\\nI think it\\'s romantic\\nMe too! Oh! Did you ever see An Officer and a Gentleman\\nYeah\\nWell, he\\'s kinda like the guy I went to see that with. Except, except he-he\\'s smarter, and gentler, and sweeter... I just- I just wanna be with him all the time. Day and night, and night and day... and special occasions..\\nWait a minute, wait a minute, I see where this is going, you\\'re gonna ask him to New Year\\'s, aren\\'t you. You\\'re gonna break the pact. She\\'s gonna break the pact\\nNo, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah, could I just\\nYeah, \\'cause I already asked Janice\\nWhat?\\nC\\'mon, this was a pact! This was your pact\\nI snapped, okay? I couldn\\'t handle the pressure and I snapped\\nYeah, but Janice? That-that was like the worst breakup in history\\nI\\'m not saying it was a good idea, I\\'m saying I snapped\\nHi. Hi, sorry I\\'m late\\nToo many jokes... must mock Joey\\nNice shoes, huh\\nAah, y\\'killing me\\nRoss! He\\'s playing with my spatulas again\\nOkay, look, he\\'s not gonna hurt them, right\\nDo you always have to bring him here\\nI didn\\'t wanna leave him alone. Alright? We- we had our first fight this morning. I think it has to do with my working late. I said some things that I didn\\'t mean, and he- he threw some faeces..\\nY\\'know, if you\\'re gonna work late, I could look in on him for you\\nOh, that\\'d be great! Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you\\'re there to see him, okay, and you\\'re not like doing it as a favour to me\\nOkay, but if he asks, I\\'m not going to lie\\nMax and David\\'s lab, David is explaining something to Phoebe with the aid of a whiteboard\\n...But, you can\\'t actually test this theory, because today\\'s particle accelerators are nowhere near powerful enough to simulate these conditions\\nOkay, alright, I have a question, then\\nYuh\\nUm, were you planning on kissing me ever\\nUh, that\\'s definitely a, uh, valid question. And, uh, the answer would be (Writes YES on the board) yes. Yes I was. But, see, I wanted it to be this phenomenal kiss that happened at this phenomenal moment, because, well, \\'cause it\\'s you\\nSure\\nRight. But, see, the longer I waited, the more phenomenal the kiss had to be, and now we\\'ve reached a place where it\\'s just gotta be one of those things where I just like... sweep everything off the table and throw you down on it. And, uh, I\\'m not really a, uh, sweeping sorta fella\\nOh, David, I, I think you are a sweeping sorta fella. I mean, you\\'re a sweeper! ...trapped inside a physicist\\'s body\\nRrrreally\\nOh, yeah, oh, I\\'m sure of it. You should just do it, just sweep and throw me\\n...Now? Now\\nOh yeah, right now\\nOkay, okay, okay. (Gets ready to sweep, and then picks up a laptop computer) Y\\'know what, this was just really expensive. (Puts it down elsewhere. Then picks up a microscope) And I\\'ll take- this was a gift\\nOkay, now you\\'re just kinda tidying\\nOkay, what the hell, what the hell. (Sweeps the remaining papers off the desk and grabs Phoebe) You want me to actually throw you or you-you wanna just hop\\nI can hop\\nCentral Perk, everyone is there\\nSo tell me something. What does the phrase \\'no date pact\\' mean to you\\nI\\'m sorry, okay. It\\'s just that Chandler has somebody, and Phoebe has somebody- I thought I\\'d ask Fun Bobby\\nFun Bobby? Your ex-boyfriend Fun Bobby\\nYeah\\nYou know more than one Fun Bobby\\nI happen to know a Fun Bob\\n(Brings Joey a mug of coffee) Okay, here we go..\\nOoh ooh ooh ooh, there\\'s no room for milk\\n(Glances at Joey and then sips his coffee) There. Now there is\\nOkay, so on our no-date evening, three of you now have dates\\nUh, four\\nFour\\nFive\\nFive\\nSorry. Paolo\\'s catching an earlier flight\\nYeah, and I met this really hot single mom at the store. What\\'s an elf to do\\nOkay, so I\\'m gonna be the only one standing there alone when the ball drops\\nOh, c\\'mon. We\\'ll have, we\\'ll have a big party, and no-one\\'ll know who\\'s with who\\nHey, y\\'know, this is so not what I needed right now\\nWhat\\'s the matter\\nOh, it\\'s-it\\'s Marcel. He keeps shutting me out, y\\'know? He\\'s walking around all the time dragging his hands..\\nThat\\'s so weird, I had such a blast with him the other night\\nReally\\nYeah, we played, we watched TV.. that juggling thing is amazing\\nWhat, uh... what juggling thing\\nWith the balled-up socks? I figured you taught him that\\nNo\\nY\\'know, it wasn\\'t that big a deal. He just balled up socks... and a melon..\\nPhoebe. Hi\\nOh, hi Max! Hey, do you know everybody\\nNo. Have you seen David\\nNo, no, he hasn\\'t been around\\nWell, if you see him, tell him to pack his bags. We are going to Minsk\\nMinsk\\nMinsk. It\\'s in Russia\\nI know where Minsk is\\nWe got the grant. Three years, all expenses paid\\nSo when, when do you leave\\nJanuary first\\nMax and David\\'s lab, they are working\\nHello\\nHey\\nHi\\nHi! (Kisses her) What-what\\'re you doing here\\nUm, well, Max told me about Minsk, so (Puts on a fake cheery voice) congratulations! This is so exciting\\nIt\\'d be even more exciting if we were going\\nOh, you\\'re not going? (Fake disappointed voice) Oh, why\\nTell her, David. \\'I don\\'t wanna go to Minsk and work with Lifson and Yamaguchi and Flench, on nonononononono. I wanna stay here and make out with my girlfriend!\\nThank you, Max. Thank you\\nSo-so you\\'re really not going\\nI don\\'t know. I don\\'t know what I\\'m gonna do. I just- you decide\\nOh don\\'t do that\\nPlease\\nOh no no\\nOkay, um, stay\\nStay\\nStay\\nGetting so good at that\\nIt was Max\\'s stuff\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, the party has started\\nI love this artichoke thing! Oh, don\\'t tell me what\\'s in it, the diet starts tomorrow\\nYou remember Janice\\nVividly\\nHi\\nHi, I\\'m Sandy\\nSandy! Hi! C\\'mon in! (She enters, followed by a young boy and a younger girl)...You brought your kids\\nYeah. That\\'s okay, right\\nPar-tay\\nThat thing is not coming in here\\n\\'That thing\\'? This is how you greet guests at a party? Let me ask you something, if I showed up here with my new girlfriend, she wouldn\\'t be welcome in your home\\nI\\'m guessing your new girlfriend wouldn\\'t urinate on my coffee table\\nOkay. He was more embarrassed about that than anyone. Okay? And for him to have the courage to walk back in here like nothing happened..\\nAlright. Just keep him away from me\\nThank you. (She walks off) C\\'mon, Marcel, whaddya say you and I do a little mingling? (Marcel runs off) Alright, I\\'ll, uh... catch up with you later\\nOh my gosh! Rachel, honey.. are you okay? Where-where\\'s Paolo\\nRome. Jerk missed his flight\\nAnd then... your face is bloated\\nNo. Okay. I was at the airport, getting into a cab, when this woman- this blonde planet with a pocketbook- starts yelling at me. Something about how it was her cab first. And then the next thing I know she just starts- starts pulling me out by my hair! So I\\'m blowing my attack whistle thingy and three more cabs show up, and as I\\'m going to get into a cab she tackles me. And I hit my head on the kerb and cut my lip on my whistle...oh...everybody having fun at the party? (To Monica) Are people eating my dip\\nY\\'know, when I saw you at the store last week, it was probably the first time I ever mentally undressed an elf\\nWow, that\\'s, uh, dirty\\nYeah\\nHey, kids..\\n(Watching Marcel play with Phoebe. To Chandler) Look at him. I\\'m not saying he has to spend the whole evening with me, but at least check in\\n(Startles them) There you are! Haaah, you got away from me\\n(Imitating) But you found me\\nHere, Ross, take our picture. (Hands him a camera and he starts snapping) Smile! You\\'re on Janice Camera\\nKill me. Kill me now\\nHey everybody! It\\'s Fun Bobby\\nHey, sorry I\\'m late. But my, uh, grandfather, he- died about two hours ago. But I-I-I couldn\\'t get a flight out \\'til tomorrow, so here I am\\n(Approaching) Hey Fun Bobby! Whoah! Who died\\nIt\\'s gonna be an open casket, y\\'know, so at least I\\'ll- I get to see him again\\n(Ross is still taking their photo) Oh, I\\'m gonna blow this one up, and I\\'m gonna write \\'Reunited\\' in glitter\\nAlright, Janice, that\\'s it! Janice... Janice..\\nOh, no. Oh, no\\nI\\'m sorry you misunderstood..\\nOh my God. You listen to me, Chandler, you listen to me. One of these times is just gonna be your last chance with me\\nOh, will you give me the thing\\nHi, Max\\nYoko. (To David) I\\'ve decided to go to Minsk without you\\nWow\\nIt won\\'t be the same- but it\\'ll still be Minsk. Happy New Year\\nAre you alright\\nYeah, I\\'m fine, I\\'m fine\\nYou\\'re going to Minsk\\nNo, I\\'m... not going to Minsk\\nOh, you are so going to Minsk. You belong in Minsk. You can\\'t stay here just \\'cause of me\\nYes I can. Because if I go it means I have to break up with you, and I can\\'t break up with you\\nOh yes, yes, yes you can. Just say, um, \\'Phoebe, my work is my life and that\\'s what I have to do right now\\'. And I say \\'your work?! Your work?! How can you say that?!\\'. And then you say, um, \\'it\\'s tearing me apart, but I have no choice. Can\\'t you understand that?\\'. And I say (Hits him) \\'no! No! I can\\'t understand that!\\'\\nUh, ow\\nOoh, sorry. Um, and, and then you put your arms around me. And then you put your arms around me. (He does so) And, um, and then you tell me that you love me and you\\'ll never forget me\\nI\\'ll never forget you\\nAnd then you say that it\\'s almost midnight and you have to go because you don\\'t wanna start the new year with me if you can\\'t finish it. (They kiss) I\\'m gonna miss you. You scientist guy\\n(on TV) Hi, this is Dick Clark, live in Times Square. We\\'re in a virtual snowstorm of confetti here in Times Square..\\nThere y\\'go, kids\\n(To a woman who he has clearly just met) And then the peacock bit me. (Laughs) Please kiss me at midnight\\nYou seen Sandy\\nOoh. Uh, I don\\'t know how to tell you this, but she\\'s in Monica\\'s bedroom, getting it on with Max, that scientist geek. Ooh, look at that, I did know how to tell you\\nVrrbddy, the bll is drrbing\\n(in the kitchen) What\\nThe bll is drrbing\\n(on TV) In twenty seconds it\\'ll be midnight..\\nAnd the moment of joy is upon us\\nLooks like that no date pact thing worked out\\nEverybody looks so happy. I hate that\\nNot everybody\\'s happy. Hey Bobby\\nY\\'know, I uh.. just thought I\\'d throw this out here. I\\'m no math whiz, but I do believe there are three girls and three guys right here\\nI dunno. I don\\'t feel like kissing anyone tonight\\nI can\\'t kiss anyone\\nSo I\\'m kissing everyone\\nNonono, you can\\'t kiss Ross, that\\'s your brother\\nPerfect. Perfect. So now everybody\\'s getting kissed but me\\nAlright, somebody kiss me. Somebody kiss me, it\\'s midnight! Somebody kiss me\\nAlrightalrightalright. (Kisses him. Ross takes a photo) There\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, time lapse\\n(Watching Marcel and talking to Rachel) I wanted this to work so much. I mean I\\'m still in there, changing his diapers, pickin\\' his fleas... but he\\'s just phoning it in. Just so hard to accept the fact that something you love so much doesn\\'t love you back\\n...I think that bitch cracked my tooth\\nA Street: Monica and Phoebe are walking to a newsstand\\nDo you think they have yesterday\\'s daily news\\nWhy\\nJust wanna check my horoscope, see if it was right\\nOh my God. (Grabs Phoebe and turns her away) Phoebe. Don\\'t look now, but behind us is a guy who has the potential to break our hearts and plunge us into a pit of depression\\nWhere? (Turns to face him) Ooh, come to Momma\\nHe\\'s coming. Be cool, be cool, be cool\\nNice hat\\n(in unison) Thanks\\nWe should do something. Whistle\\nWe are not going to whistle\\nCome on, do it\\nNo\\nDo it\\nNo\\nDo it do it do it\\n(Shouts to the guy) Woo-woo\\nI can\\'t believe you did that\\nHospital, the guy is in a coma and Mon and Pheebs are visiting\\nWhy did I \\'woo-hoo\\'? I mean, what was I hoping would happen? That-that he\\'d turn round and say \\'I love that sound, I must have you now\\'\\nI just wish there was something we could do. (Bends down and talks to him) Hello. Hello, Coma Guy. GET UP, YOU GIRL SCOUT! UP! UP! UP\\nPhoebe, what are you doing\\nMaybe nobody\\'s tried this\\nI wish we at least knew his name... Look at that face. I mean, even sleeping, he looks smart. I bet he\\'s a lawyer\\nYeah, but did you see the dents in his knuckles? That means he\\'s artistic\\nOkay, he\\'s a lawyer, who teaches sculpting on the side. And- he can dance\\nOh! And, he\\'s the kinda guy who, when you\\'re talking, he\\'s listening, y\\'know, and not saying \\'Yeah, I understand\\' but really wondering what you look like naked\\nI wish all guys could be like him\\nI know\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, Monica and Phoebe are telling everyone about their coma guy\\nAre there no conscious men in the city for you two\\nHe doesn\\'t have anyone\\nYeah, we-we feel kinda responsible\\nI can\\'t believe you said woowoo. I don\\'t even say woowoo\\nOh, she\\'s coming up! She\\'s coming up\\n(on TV) Folks, when we come back we\\'ll be talking about her new book, \\'Euphoria Unbound\\': the always interesting Nora Tyler Bing. You might wanna put the kids to bed for this one\\nY\\'know, we don\\'t have to watch this. Weekend At Bernie\\'s is on Showtime, HBO, and Cinemax\\nNo way, forget it\\nC\\'mon, she\\'s your mom\\nExactly. Weekend At Bernie\\'s! Dead guy getting hit in the groin twenty, thirty times! No\\nChandler, I gotta tell you, I love your mom\\'s books! I love her books! I cannot get on a plane without one! I mean, this is so cool\\nYeah, well, you wouldn\\'t think it was cool if you\\'re eleven years old and all your friends are passing around page 79 of \\'Mistress Bitch\\nC\\'mon, Chandler, I love your mom. I think she\\'s a blast\\nYou can say that because she\\'s not your mom\\nOh, please..\\nBona sera\\nOh, hi sweetie\\nWhen did Rigatoni get back from Rome\\nLast night\\nAh, so then his plane didn\\'t explode in a big ball of fire?... Just a dream I had- but, phew\\nHey hey hey! She\\'s on\\nAh! Nora Bing\\n(on TV) ...Now what is this about you-you being arrested i-in London? What is that all about\\nYour mom was arrested\\nShhh, busy beaming with pride\\n(on TV) ...This is kind of embarrassing, but occasionally after I\\'ve been intimate with a man..\\nNow why would she say that\\'s embarrassing\\nShhh\\n(on TV) ...I just get this craving for Kung Pow Chicken\\nTHAT\\'S TOO MUCH INFORMATION!\\n(on TV) Alright, so now you\\'re doing this whole book tour thing, how is that going\\n(on TV) Oh, fine. I\\'m leaving for New York tomorrow, which I hate- but I get to see my son, who I love..\\nAwww\\nThis is the way that I find out. Most moms use the phone\\n(on TV) Y\\'know, don\\'t take this wrong, I-I just don\\'t see you a-as a mom, somehow.. I don\\'t mean that, I don\\'t mean that bad..\\n(on TV) Oh no, I am a fabulous mom!

No, no, in fact, you\\'re not having a boy\\nWha-I\\'m having, I\\'m having a boy! (babbling) Huh, am I having a boy\\nYes, you\\'re having a boy\\nI\\'m having a boy! Oh, I\\'m having a boy\\nWhat is it\\nI\\'m having a boy! I-I\\'m having a boy\\nHey\\nHey\\nWe already knew that\\nI\\'m having a son. Um..\\nChandler and Joey\\'s, Monica is busy killing Chandle and Joey at foosball\\nYes! And that would be a shut-down\\nShut-out!! (They both start heading for their rooms\\nWhere are you guys going? Come on, one more game\\nUh, it\\'s 2:30 in the morning\\nYeah, get out\\nYou guys are always hanging out in my apartment! Come on, I\\'ll only use my left hand, huh? Come on, wussies! (Joey and Chandler pick her up) All right, ok, I gotta go. I\\'m going, (they throw her out) and I\\'m gone\\n(to Joey) One more game\\nOh yeah\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, Chandler walks in and starts raiding the fridge. Then Rachel comes out of the shower with a towel wrapped round her waist, drying herself with another towel. Chandler and Rachel startle each other and she drops the towel for a second and snatches the rug off the couch\\nThat is it\\nI\\'m sorry\\nYou have no respect for anybody\\'s privacy\\nRachel, wait, wait\\nNo, you wait! This is ridiculous\\nCan I just say one thing\\nWhat? What?\\nThat\\'s a relatively open weave and I can still see your... nipular areas\\nOh!\\nCentral Perk, Phoebe is there with her boyfriend Roger, talking to Rachel and Monica\\nOh, honey, honey, tell them the story about your patient who thinks things are, like, other things. Y\\'know? Like, the phone rings and she takes a shower\\nThat\\'s pretty much it\\nOops\\nBut you tell it really well, sweetie\\nThanks. Okay, now go away so we can talk about you\\nOkay. I\\'ll miss you\\nIsn\\'t he great\\nHe\\'s so cute! And he seems to like you so much\\nI know, I know. So sweet... and so complicated. And for a shrink, he\\'s not too shrinky, y\\'know\\nSo, you think you\\'ll do it on his couch\\nOh, I don\\'t know, I don\\'t know. I think that\\'s a little weird, y\\'know? Vinyl\\nOkaaay. (To the guys, on the couch) Any of you guys want anything else\\nOh, yes, could I have one of those\\nNo, I\\'m sorry, we\\'re all out of those. Anybody else\\nOkay\\nDid I, uh, did I miss something\\nNo, she\\'s still upset because I saw her boobies\\nYou what? Wh what were you doing seeing her boobies\\nIt was an accident. Not like I was across the street with a telescope and a box of donuts\\nOkay, okay, could we change the subject, please\\nYeah, \\'cause hello, these are not her boobies, these are her breasts\\nOkay, Pheebs, I was hoping for more of a change\\nY\\'know, I don\\'t know why you\\'re so embarrassed, they were very nice boobies\\nNice? They were nice. I mean, that\\'s it? I mean, mittens are nice\\nOkaaay, (Gestures) rock, hard place, me\\nYou\\'re so funny! He\\'s really funny! I wouldn\\'t wanna be there when when the laughter stops\\nWhoah whoah, back up there, Sparky. What\\'d you mean by that\\nOh, just seems as though that maybe you have intimacy issues. Y\\'know, that you use your humour as a way of keeping people at a distance\\nHuh\\nI mean hey! I just met you, I don\\'t know you from Adam. ...Only child, right? Parents divorced before you hit puberty\\nUhhuh, how did you know that\\nIt\\'s textbook\\nHey you guys. Hey, you all know my dad, right\\nHey! Hey, Mr. Trib\\nHey, how long are you in the city\\nJust for a coupla days. I got a job midtown. I figure I\\'m better off staying with the kid than hauling my ass back and forth on the ferry. (Sees Roger) I don\\'t know this one\\nOh, this is my friend Roger\\nHi\\nHey, hey. Good to meet you, Roger\\nYou too, sir\\n(To Phoebe) What happened to the, uh, puppet guy\\nDad, dad\\nOh, \\'scuse me. So Ross, uh, how\\'s the wife? (Ross whines and lays his head on Chandler\\'s shoulder) Off there too, uh? Uh, Chandler, quick, say something funny\\nChandler and Joey\\'s, Mr. Tribbiani is on the phone\\nGotta go\\n(Snatches the phone) Hey Ma. Listen, I made the appointment with Dr. Bazida, and... Excuse me? (To his dad) Did you know this isn\\'t Ma\\nHer name\\'s Ronni. She\\'s a pet mortician\\nSure. So how long you been..\\nRemember when you were a little kid, I used to take you to the navy yard and show you the big ships\\nSince then?\\nNo, it\\'s only been six years. I just wanted to put a nice memory in your head so you\\'d know that I wasn\\'t always such a terrible guy. ...Joe. Y\\'ever been in love\\n...I d\\'know\\nThen y\\'haven\\'t. You\\'re burning your tomatoes\\nYou\\'re one to talk\\nJoe, your dad\\'s in love big time. And the worst part of it is, it\\'s with two different women\\nOh man. Please tell me one of \\'em is Ma\\nOf course, course one of \\'em\\'s Ma. What\\'s the matter with you\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, Joey is lamenting to everyone about hid dad\\'s affair\\nIt\\'s like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was leading this double life. He\\'s like actually some spy, working for the C.I.A. (Considers) That\\'d be cool.... This blows\\nI know, I mean, why can\\'t parents just stay parents? (She walks over near Chandler and his gaze stays very obviously on her chest) Why do they have to become people? Why do they have... (Notices Chandler) Why can\\'t you stop staring at my breasts\\n(Without looking up) What? (Looks up) What\\nDid you not get a good enough look the other day\\nAlright, alright. We\\'re all adults here, there\\'s only one way to resolve this. Since you saw her boobies, I think, uh, you\\'re gonna have to show her your peepee\\nY\\'know, I don\\'t see that happening\\nC\\'mon, he\\'s right. Tit for tat\\nWell I\\'m not showing you my \\'tat\\nHello\\n(Intercom) It\\'s Phoebe\\n(Intercom) And Rog\\nC\\'mon up\\n(Sarcastic) Oh, good. Rog is here\\nWhat\\'s the matter with Rog\\nYeah\\nOh, it\\'s nothing, it\\'s a little thing... I hate that guy\\nWhat, so he was a little analytical. That\\'s what he does, y\\'know? C\\'mon, he\\'s not that bad\\nY\\'see, that\\'s where you\\'re wrong. Why would I marry her if I thought on any level thatthat she was a lesbian\\nI dunno. Maybe you wanted your marriage to fail\\nWhy? Why would I why? Why? Why? Why\\nI don\\'t know. Maybe maybe low self-esteem, maybe maybe to compensate for overshadowing a sibling, maybe you..\\nWait-wait, go back to that sibling thing\\nWell, I don\\'t know. I mean, it\\'s conceivable that you wanted to sabotage your marriage so that the sibling would feel less of a failure in the eyes of the parents\\nThat that\\'s ridiculous! I don\\'t feel guilty for her failures\\nOh! So you think I\\'m a failure\\nIsn\\'t he good\\nNonono, thatthat\\'s not what I was saying..\\nY\\'know, all these years, I thought you were on my side. But maybe what you were doing was sucking up to Mom and Dad so they\\'d keep liking you better\\nHey, I married a lesbian to make you look good\\nYou\\'re right! I mean you\\'re right! It wasn\\'t just the Weebles, but it was the Weeble Play Palace, and and the Weebles\\' Cruise Ship. Oh, which had this little lifeboat for the Weebles to wobble in\\nThat\\'s tough. Tough stuff. C\\'mon, Pheebs, we\\'re gonna catch that movie, we gotta get going\\nOh, okay. Feel better, Rachel, \\'kay\\nGeez, we\\'re gonna be late, sweetie..\\nOh, okay. Listen, thanks for everything, Mon\\nYou\\'re welcome\\nListen guys, it was great seeing you again. Mon, um, easy on those cookies, okay? Remember, they\\'re just food, they\\'re not love\\nHate that guy\\nThe Hallway, Chandler and Joey are just leaving Monica and Rachel\\'s\\nNight, you guys\\nOh look, it\\'s the woman we ordered\\nHey. Can, uh, can we help you\\nOh, no thanks, I\\'m just waiting for, uh, Joey Tribbiani\\nI\\'m Joey Tribbiani\\nOh no, not you, big Joey. Oh my God, you\\'re so much cuter than your pictures! (Joey stares at her) I-I\\'m, I\\'m Ronni....Cheese Nip\\nUh, Joey\\'s having an embolism, but I\\'d go for a Nip, y\\'know\\nChandler and Joey\\'s, Ronni is talking to Chandler. Joey\\'s dad is not around\\nNow, y\\'see, most people, when their pets pass on, they want \\'em sorta laid out like they\\'re sleeping. But occasionally you get your person who wants them in a pose. Like, chasing their tail, (Demonstrates) or, uh, jumping to catch a frisbee\\nJoey, if I go first, I wanna be looking for my keys\\nThat\\'s a good one\\nHey, Joe\\nDad, Ronni\\'s here\\nHuh\\nHi\\nHey! Hello, babe! Wh what\\'re what\\'re you doing here\\nOh, uh, well, you left your good hair at my apartment, I figured you\\'d need it tomorrow for your meeting\\nThank you. Uh..\\nSo, who\\'s up for a big game of Kerplunk\\nLook, I uh, I shouldn\\'ta come. I-I\\'d better get going, I don\\'t wanna miss the last train\\nI don\\'t want you taking that thing\\nOh, where\\'m I gonna stay, here\\nWho-ah-ho\\nWe\\'ll go to a hotel\\n(Shrugs) We\\'ll go to a hotel\\nNo you won\\'t\\nNo we won\\'t\\nIf you go to a hotel you\\'ll be...doing stuff. I want you right here where I can keep an eye on you\\nYou\\'re gonna keep an eye on us\\nThat\\'s right, mister, and I don\\'t care how old you are, as long as you\\'re under my roof you\\'re gonna live by my rules. And that means no sleeping with your girlfriend\\nWow. He\\'s strict\\nNow dad, you\\'ll be in my room, Ronni uh, you can stay in Chandler\\'s room\\nThanks. You\\'re, uh, you\\'re a good kid\\nC\\'mon, I\\'ll show you to my room. ...That sounds so weird when it\\'s not followed by \"No thanks, it\\'s late\\nOkay. Now this is just for tonight. Starting tomorrow, you gotta make a change. This has gone on long enough\\nWhat kinda change\\nI can\\'t do that\\nThen you gotta come clean with Ma! This is not right\\nI don\\'t wanna hear it! Now go to my room\\nChandler and Joey\\'s, night. Chandler and Joey are sharing the sofabed in the living room. Joey is restless\\nHey, Kicky. What\\'re you doing\\nJust trying to get comfortable. I can\\'t sleep in my underwear\\nWell, you\\'re gonna\\nI\\'ve been thinking. Y\\'know, about how I\\'m always seeing girls on top of girls..\\nAre they end to end, or tall like pancakes\\nY\\'know what I mean, about how I\\'m always going out with all these women. And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I\\'d be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y\\'know? Now I\\'m looking at my dad, thinking..\\nHey, you\\'re not him. You\\'re you. When they were all over you to go into your father\\'s pipe-fitting business, did you cave\\nNo\\nNo. You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business. Now that wasn\\'t easy, but you did it! And I\\'d like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say \"No thanks, I\\'m married\\nYou really think so\\nYeah. I really do\\nThanks, Chandler\\nGet off\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, morning. Someone knocks on the door and Monica gets it\\nHi\\nHi...May I help you\\nYeah, uh, Joey said I could use your shower, since, uh, Chandler\\'s in ours\\nOkay...who are you\\nOh, I\\'m Ronni. Ronni Rappelano? The mistress\\nOh, c\\'mon in\\nThanks\\nHi, I\\'m Rachel\\nHi\\nBathroom\\'s up there\\nGreat\\nHey, listen, Ronni, how long would you say Chandler\\'s been in the shower\\nOh, like, uh, five minutes\\nPerfect. Fasten your seatbelts, it\\'s peepee time. (She goes into Joey and Chandler\\'s apartment, where Mr. Tribbiani is reading the paper) Hey, Mr. Trib\\nHey. Morning, dear\\nChandler Bing? It\\'s time to see your thing\\n(Runs out in a towel) What\\'s the matter with you?\\nI thought it was Chandler\\n(Comes out of his room) What? What\\nYou were supposed to be in there so I could see your thing\\nSorry, my my thing was in there with me\\nCentral Perk, everyone is there as Phoebe enters\\nHey, Pheebs\\nHey\\nHow\\'s it going\\nGood. Oh oh! Roger\\'s having a dinner thing and he wanted me to invite you guys\\nSo what\\'s going on\\nNothing, um, it\\'s just, um... It\\'s Roger\\nI dunno, there\\'s just something about..\\nBasically we just feel that he\\'s..\\nWe hate that guy\\nYeah. Hate him\\nWe\\'re sorry, Pheebs, we\\'re sorry\\nUh-huh. Okay. Okay, don\\'t you think, maybe, though, it\\'s just that he\\'s so perceptive that it freaks you out\\n...No, we hate him\\nWe\\'re sorry\\nChandler and Joey\\'s apartment, Joey is trying to turn the sofabed back into a sofa. Someone knocks on the door and it rears up at him\\nMa! What\\'re you doing here\\nI came to give you this (Gives him a bag of groceries) and this\\nOww! Big ring\\nWhy did you have to fill your father\\'s head with all that garbage about making things right? Things were fine the way they were! There\\'s chicken in there, put it away. For God\\'s sake, Joey, really\\nHold on, you-you knew\\nOf course I knew! What did you think? Your father is no James Bond. You should\\'ve heard some of his cover stories. \"I\\'m sleeping over at my accountant\\'s,\" I mean, what is that? Please\\nSo then how could you I mean, how could you?\\nDo you remember how your father used to be? Always yelling, always yelling nothing made him happy, nothing made him happy, not that wood shop, not those stupid little ships in the bottle, nothing. Now he\\'s happy! I mean, it\\'s nice, he has a hobby\\nMa, I don\\'t mean to be disrespectful, but... what the hell are you talking about?! I mean, what about you\\nMe? I\\'m fine. Look, honey, in an ideal world, there\\'d be no her, and your father would look like Sting. And I\\'ll tell you something else. Ever since that poodle-stuffer came along, he\\'s been so ashamed of himself that he\\'s been more attentive, he\\'s been more loving... I mean, it\\'s like every day\\'s our anniversary\\nI\\'m...happy...for you\\nWell don\\'t be, because now everything\\'s screwed up. I just want it the way it was\\nMa, I\\'m sorry. I just did what I thought you\\'d want\\nI know you did, cookie. Oh, I know you did. So tell me. Did you see her\\nYeah. You\\'re ten times prettier than she is\\nThat\\'s sweet. Could I take her\\nWith this ring? (Her engagement ring.) No contest\\nCentral Perk. Phoebe is there with Roger\\nWhat\\'s wrong, sweetie\\nNothing, nothing\\nAaaah, what\\'s wrong, c\\'mon. (Pats his leg\\nIt\\'s, I mean, it\\'s nothing, I\\'m fine. It\\'s my friends. They-they have a liking problem with you. In that, um, they don\\'t\\nOh. They don\\'t\\nBut they don\\'t see all the wonderfulness that I see. They don\\'t see all the good stuff and all the sweet stuff. They just think you\\'re a little..\\nWhat\\nIntense and creepy\\nOh\\nBut I don\\'t. Me, Phoebe\\nWell, I\\'m not I\\'m not at all surprised they feel that way\\nYou\\'re not? See, that\\'s why you\\'re so great\\nActually it\\'s, it\\'s quite, y\\'know, typical behaviour when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic. Y\\'know, this kind of co-dependant, emotionally stunted, sitting in your stupid coffee house with your stupid big cups which, I\\'m sorry, might as well have nipples on them, and you\\'re like all \\'Oh, define me! Define me! Love me, I need love!\\'\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, Joey is letting everyone in on the new developments\\nSo you talked to your dad, huh\\nYeah. He\\'s gonna keep cheating on my ma like she wanted, she\\'s gonna keep pretending she doesn\\'t know even though she does, and my little sister Tina can\\'t see her husband any more because he got a restraining order...which has nothing to do with anything except that I found out today\\nWow\\nThings sure have changed here on Waltons mountain\\nSo Joey, you okay\\nYeah, I guess. It\\'s just parents, after a certain point, you gotta let go. Even if you know better, you\\'ve gotta let them make their own mistakes\\nJust think, in a couple of years we get to turn into them\\nIf I turn into my parents, I\\'ll either be an alcoholic blond chasing after twenty-year-old boys, or... I\\'ll end up like my mom\\n(entering) Hey\\nHey, Pheebs\\nHow\\'s it going\\nOh, okay, except I broke up with Roger\\nAwww\\nYeah, right\\nAaawwwwww!\\nWhat happened\\nI don\\'t know, I mean, he\\'s a good person, and he can be really sweet, and in some ways I think he is so right for me, it\\'s just... I hate that guy\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s. Phoebe is reading the paper and Joey enters\\nHey, Joey. What\\'s going on\\nClear the tracks for the boobie payback express. Next stop: Rachel Green. (He goes into the bathroom\\nJoey!! What the hell were you doing?\\nSorry. Wrong boobies\\nHello, Joey\\nOh! ...Hello, dear\\nCentral Perk, Ross is eyeing a beautiful woman at the counter, and Joey and Chandler are egging him on to go talk to her. No pun intended. I mean it\\nI\\'m tellin\\' you Ross, she wants you\\nShe barely knows me. We just live in the same building\\nAny contact\\nShe lent me an egg once\\nYou\\'re in\\nAw, right\\nHi, Ross\\nHey\\nCome on, Ross, you gotta get back in the game here, ok? The Rachel thing\\'s not happening, your ex-wife is a lesbianÑI don\\'t think we need a third..\\nExcuse me, could we get an egg over here, still in the shell? Thanks\\nAn egg\\nYeah, you\\'re gonna go up to her and say, \"Here\\'s your egg back, I\\'m returning your egg\\nI think it\\'s winning\\nI think it\\'s insane\\nShe\\'ll love it. Go with the egg, my friend\\nThink it\\'ll work\\nNo, it\\'s suicide. The man\\'s got an egg\\nCentral Perk, Monica, Rachel, Phoebe, Joey, Chandler are there. Ross is still talking to the beautiful woman\\nYou can not do this\\nDo what, do what\\nRoger wants to take her out tomorrow night\\nNo! Phoebes! Don\\'t you remember why you dumped the guy\\n\\'Cause he was creepy, and mean, and a little frightening... alright, still, it\\'s nice to have a date on Valentine\\'s Day\\nBut Phoebe, you can go out with a creepy guy any night of the year. I know I do\\nWell, what are you guys doing tomorrow night\\nActually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes\\nOh, uh, listen, about tonight..\\nNo, no, no, don\\'t you dare bail on me. The only reason she\\'s goin\\' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend\\nYes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a..\\nPathetic mess? I know, butÑcome on, man, she\\'s needy, she\\'s vulnerable. I\\'m thinkin\\', cha-ching! (Rachel throws a roll at Joey. He picks it up and eats it.) Thanks. Look, you have not been out with a woman since Janice. You\\'re doin\\' this\\nHi. She said yes\\nYes! Way to go, man! (Chandler and Ross hug. Something crunches in Ross\\' shirt pocket.) Still got the egg, huh\\nA Restaurant, Joey and Chandler are there, waiting for their dates to show up\\n(Looking at himself in the reflection on a knife) How do I look\\nOh, uh, I... don\\'t... care. (Joey\\'s date shows up) Ok, now, remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess\\nHi, Joey. Well well, look what you brought. Very nice\\n...And what did you bring\\nShe\\'s checking the coats. Joey, I\\'m gonna go wash the cab smell off my hands. Will you get me a white Zinfandel, and a glass of red for Janice\\nJanice\\nOh.... my.... God\\n(angrily) Hey, it\\'s Janice\\nThe bathroom at the restaurant, Chandler and Joey are talking\\nOk, I\\'m makin\\' a break for it, I\\'m goin\\' out the window\\nNo, no, no, don\\'t! I\\'ve been waitin\\' for like, forever to go out with Lorraine. Just calm down\\nCalm down? Calm down? You set me up with the woman that I\\'ve dumped twice in the last five months\\n(at the urinal) Can you stop yellin\\'? You\\'re makin\\' me nervous, and I can\\'t go when I\\'m nervous\\nI\\'m sorry, I\\'m sorry, you\\'re right. (gets up right behind Joey and yells in his ear) Come on, do it, do it, go, come on!!\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, the girls are all there, discussing their bad luck with men\\nOk, ok, Roger was creepy, but he was nothing compared to Pete Carney\\nWhich one was Pete Carney\\nPete the Weeper? Remember that guy who used to cry every time we had sex. (imitating) \"Was it good for you\\nYeah, well, I\\'ll take a little crying any day over Howard-the-\"I-win\"-guy. (imitating) \"I win! I win!\" I went out with the guy for two monthsÑI didn\\'t get to win once\\nHow did we end up with these jerks? We\\'re good people\\nI don\\'t know. Maybe we\\'re some kinda magnets\\nI know I am. That\\'s why I can\\'t wear a digital watch\\nThere\\'s more beer, right\\nOh! You know my friend Abby who shaves her head? She said that if you want to break the bad boyfriend cycle, you can do like a cleansing ritual\\nPheebes, this woman is voluntarily bald\\nYeah. So, we can do it tomorrow night, you guys. It\\'s Valentine\\'s Day. It\\'s perfect\\nOk, well, what kind of ritual\\nOk. We can, um, we can burn the stuff they gave us\\nOr\\nOr...or we can chant and dance around naked, you know, with sticks\\nBurning\\'s good\\nBurning\\'s good. Yeah, I got stuff to burn\\nThe Restaurant, Joey, Lorraine, Chandler, and Janice are at the table. Joey and Lorraine are seated very close, Chandler and Janice have backed their chairs away from one another\\nYou know, ever since I was little, I\\'ve been able to pick up quarters with my toes\\nGood for you. (jumps suddenly) Uh, quarters or rolls of quarters\\nBy the way, Chandler. I cut you out of all my pictures. So if you want, I have a bag with just your heads\\nThat\\'s OK\\nOh, are you sure? Really? Because you know, you could make little puppets out of them, and you could use them in your theater of cruelty\\n(to Lorraine) We can\\'t do that\\n(disgusted) What? What can\\'t you do\\nUh, can I talk to you for a second, over there\\nUh, we might be leaving now\\nTell me it\\'s \"you and me\" we\\nShe said she wants to slather my body with stuff and then lick it off. I\\'m not even sure what slathering is, but I definitely want to be a part of it\\nOk, you can not do this to me\\nYou\\'re right, I\\'m sorry. You\\'re right\\n(to waiter) Uh, can we have three chocolate mousses to go please\\nI\\'m outta here. Here\\'s my credit card. Dinner\\'s on me. I\\'m sorry, Chandler\\nI hope she throws up on you\\nSo..\\nJust us\\nOh, what a crappy night\\nAlthough, I have enjoyed the fact that, uh your shirt\\'s been stickin\\' outta your zipper ever since you came back from the bathroom\\nExcuse me. (gets up, jumps up and down while he zips his zipper up... other patrons look at him) How ya doin\\'\\nSo, do we have the best friends or what\\nJoey\\'s not a friend. He\\'s...a stupid man who left us his credit card. Another drink? Some dessert? A big screen TV\\nI will go for that drink\\nYou got it. Good woman! (the waiter turns around, it\\'s a man) Could we get a bottle of your most overpriced champagne\\nEach\\nThat\\'s right, each. Oh, and a uh Rob Roy.

He rolls over and is shocked to see Janice there\\nHappy Valentine\\'s Day\\nThe Hallway, Chandler is trying to get Janice out of his apartment\\nOh, I miss you already. Can you believe this happened\\nNo... no! And yet it did. Good-bye, Janice\\nKiss me\\nOh, Chandler, sorry\\nOhhh, Chandler, sorry!

Janice, hi\\nJanice is gonna go away now\\nI\\'ll be right back\\nOh, Joey, look who it is\\n(in disbelief) Whoa\\nOh, good, Joey\\'s home now\\nThis is so fun. This is like a reunion in the hall\\nOh, hi, Ross. Yeah. There\\'s someone I want you to say hi to. (to Chandler) He just happened to call\\nHi, Ross. Yes, it\\'s me. How did you know\\nA Chinese Restaurant, Ross is there with his date\\nI\\'m just sayin\\' if dogs do experience jet lag, then, because of the whole um, seven dog years to one human year thing, then, when a dog flies from New York to Los Angeles, he doesn\\'t just lose three hours, he loses like a week and a half\\nThat\\'s funny. Who are they\\nThe blond woman is my ex-wife, and the woman touching her is her... close, personal friend\\nYou mean they\\'re lovers\\nIf you wanna put a label on it\\nWow, uh, anything else I should know\\nNope, nope, that\\'s it\\nOh, and she\\'s pregnant with my baby. I always forget that part. (to Carol and Susan) Helloo\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, the girls are holding their boyfriend bonfire\\nOk, so now we need, um sage branches and the sacramental wine\\nAll I have is, is oregano and a Fresca\\nUm, that\\'s ok!

Now we need the semen of a righteous man\\nOk, Pheebs, you know what, if we had that, we wouldn\\'t be doing the ritual in the first place\\nCan we just start throwing things in\\nOk, yeah, ok. (she throws the directions in) Oh, OK\\n(tossing things in the fire) Ok, Barry\\'s letters.

Chandler is preparing to dump Janice again\\nHow can I dump this woman on Valentine\\'s day\\nI don\\'t know. You dumped her on New Year\\'s\\nOh, man.

Susan gets up, and has to go. Carol is left stranded)...which is funny because, that wasn\\'t even my major\\nOh no. I thought you said they could shoot the spot without you\\nI thought they could...I\\'ll try to get back as soon as I can. I\\'m sorry. (Ross realizes Kristin was expecting him to laugh, so he starts to laugh hysterically\\nNow that is funny. Hey, do you think...would it be too weird if I invited Carol over to join us? \\'Cause she\\'s, she\\'s alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad\\n(reluctantly) I guess\\nAre you sure? Great. Carol? Wanna come over and join us\\nOh, no no no. I\\'m fine. I\\'m fine\\nCome on. These people\\'ll scooch down. You guys\\'ll scooch, won\\'t you? Let\\'s try scooching! Come on. Come on.

Who asked who into whose bed\\nI did, but..\\nYou seek me out. Something deep in your soul calls out to me like a foghorn. Janice, Janice. You want me. You need me. You can\\'t live without me. And you know it. You just don\\'t know you know it. See ya\\nCall me\\nThe Chinese Restaurant, Ross and Carol are talking. Kristin is not there\\nIt\\'s not true.

They won\\'t all be like this. Some women might even stay through dinner\\nNo, it\\'s just...you know the whole \"getting on with your life\" thing. Well, do I have to? I mean, I\\'m sitting here with this cute woman, and, and, and she\\'s perfectly nice, and, but that there\\'s, that\\'s it. And um, and then I\\'m here talkin\\' to you, and, and it\\'s easy, and it\\'s fun, and, and I don\\'t, I don\\'t have to...You know, here\\'s a wacky thought. Um, what\\'s say you and I give it another shot? No no no, I know what you\\'re gonna say, you\\'re a lesbian. But what do you say we just put that aside for now you know? Let\\'s just stick a pin in it, ok? Because, we\\'re great together, you know. You can\\'t deny it. Besides, you\\'re carrying my baby. I mean, how perfect is that? But see, you know, you keep sayin\\' that, but there\\'s somethin\\' right here. I love you\\nOh, I love you too. But..\\nNo but, no but\\nYou know that thing you put over here with the pin in it?

(Rachel checks behind her ear, and finds a cinamon stick.) I\\'m sorry\\nChandler\\'s job, Chandler is typing data into his computer, he keeps typing even while taking a drink of coffee with one hand. One of his co-workers walks by\\nChandler\\nMrs. Tedlock.

Nothing\\nCentral Perk, everyone is there but Chandler. Phoebe runs in, excitedly\\nHey you guys! Chandler\\'s coming and he says he has, like, this incredible news, so when he gets here, we could all act like, you know..\\nHey\\nHey\\nNever mind. But it was going to be really good\\nWhat\\'s going on\\nWhat is it\\nSo, it\\'s a typical day at work. I\\'m inputting my numbers, and big Al calls me into his office and tells me he wants to make me processing supervisor\\nThat\\'s great\\nSo.... I quit\\nWhy\\nWhy? This was supposed to be a temp job\\nYeah, Chandler... you\\'ve been there for five years\\nIf I took this promotion, it\\'d be like admitting that this is what I actually do\\nSo was it a lot more money\\nIt doesn\\'t matter. I just don\\'t want to be one of those guys that\\'s in his office until twelve o\\'clock at night worrying about the WENUS\\n... the WENUS\\nWeekly Estimated Net Usage Systems. A processing term\\n(sarcastic) Oh. That WENUS\\nSo what\\'re you going to do\\nI don\\'t know. That\\'s the thing. I don\\'t know what I want to do. I just know I\\'m not going to figure it out working there\\nOooh! I have something you can do! I have this new massage client... Steve? (pause) Anyway, he\\'s opening up a restaurant and he\\'s looking for a head chef\\n(taps Phoebe on her shoulder) Um... hi there\\nHi! (turns back to Chandler, then to Monica) Oh, yeah, no, I know. You\\'re a chef. I know, and I thought of you first, but um, Chandler\\'s the one who needs a job right now, so...\\nYeah... I just don\\'t have that much cheffing experience. Unless it\\'s an all-toast restaurant\\n(to Monica\\'s tapping) Yeah, yeah\\nWell, what kind of food is he looking for\\nWell, he wants to do some ecclectic, so he\\'s looking for someone who can, you know, create the entire menu\\n(excited) Oh my God\\nYeah, I know! (turns to Chandler) So, what do you think\\nThanks, Phoebe. But I just don\\'t really see myself in a big white hat\\nOK. (pause) Oh Monica! Guess what\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, Chandler walks in, wearing a suit\\nCan you see my nipples through this shirt\\nNo. But don\\'t worry, I\\'m sure they\\'re still there\\nWhere are you going, Mr. Suity-Man\\nWell, I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert Pillman, career counselor a-gogo.

Brian\\'s Song\\nThe meeting with the guy went great\\nSo great! He showed me where the restaurant\\'s going to be. It\\'s this, it\\'s this cute little place on 10th Street. Not too big, not too small. Just right\\nWas it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears\\nSo anyway, I\\'m cooking dinner for him Monday night. You know, kind of like an audition. And Phoebe, he really wants you to be here, which will be great for me because then you can \\'ooh\\' and \\'ahh\\' and make yummy noises\\nWhat are you going to make\\n(as though Rachel wasn\\'t paying attention) Yummy noises\\n(pause) And Monica, what are you going to make\\nI don\\'t know. I don\\'t know. It\\'s just going to be so great\\nOoh! I know what you could make! (runs over to join Monica and Rachel in the kitchen) I know! Oh, you should definitely make that thing... you know, with the stuff? (Monica doesn\\'t know.) You know, that thing... with the stuff...? OK, I don\\'t know\\nHey guys, does anybody know a good date place in the neighborhood\\nHow about Tony\\'s? If you can finish a 32-ounce steak, it\\'s free\\nOK, ahem, hey, does anybody know a good place if you\\'re not dating a puma\\nWho are you going out with\\nOh, is this the bug lady\\n(trying to sound like a bug) Bzzzz.... I love you, Ross\\nHer name is Celia. She\\'s not a bug lady. She\\'s curator of insects at the museum\\nSo what are you guys going to do\\nOh, I just thought we could go out to dinner, and then maybe bring her back to my place and I\\'d introduce her to my monkey\\nAnd he\\'s not speaking metaphorically\\n(aside to Ross) So.... back to your place...you thinking, maybe... (gestures with hands, back and forth) huh-huh\\nWell, I don\\'t know.... (gestures) huh-huh.... but I\\'m hoping (gestures) huh-huh\\nI\\'m telling you, that monkey is a chick magnet! She\\'s going to take one look at his furry, cute little face and it\\'ll seal the deal\\nRoss\\'s apartment, Marcel is hanging from Celia\\'s hair, and she is screaming, trying to get him off\\nCelia, don\\'t worry!Ê Don\\'t scream!Ê He\\'s not going to hurt you! Soothing tones, Celia. Soothing tones! Marcel..\\nI can\\'t stand this! He\\'s got his claws in my..\\nAlright..\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, everyone is there but Ross and Chandler. Monica is making food, and having everyone try it\\n(to Joey) OK, try this salmon mousse\\n(tasting) Mmmm. Good\\nIs it better than the other salmon mousse\\nIt\\'s creamier\\nYeah, well, is that better\\nI don\\'t know. We\\'re talking about whipped fish, Monica. I\\'m just happy I\\'m keeping it down, y\\'know\\nMy God! What happened to you\\nEight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests, personality tests... and what do I learn? (he taps the results and reads them) \"You are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation\\nThat\\'s so great! \\'Cause you already know how to do that\\nCan you believe it? I mean, don\\'t I seem like somebody who should be doing something really cool?

You can see your nipples through this shirt\\n(brings a plate of tiny appetizers over) Here you go, maybe this\\'ll cheer you up\\nOoh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I\\'d better split this with you\\nIt\\'s supposed to be that small.

Bye\\nTen dollars an hour for what\\nOh, I asked one of the waitresses at work if she\\'d help me out\\n(hurt) Waitressing\\nUh-oh\\nWell... of course I thought of you! But... but..\\nBut, but\\nBut, you see, it\\'s just... this night has to go just perfect, you know? And, well, Wendy\\'s more of a... professional waitress\\nOh! I see. And I\\'ve sort of been maintaining my amateur status so that I can waitress in the Olympics\\nYou know, I don\\'t mean to brag, but I waited tables at Innsbruck in \\'76.

She took me by surprise. You know, but it wasn\\'t a total loss. I mean, we ended up cuddling\\n(sarcastic) Whoaa!! You cuddled? How many times?\\nShut up! It was nice. I just... I don\\'t think I\\'m the dirty-talking kind of guy, you know\\nWhat\\'s the big deal? You just say what you want to do to her. Or what you want her to do to you. Or what you think other people might be doing to each other. I\\'ll tell you what. Just try something on me\\n(deadpan) Please be kidding\\nWhy not? Come on! Just, just close your eyes and tell me what you\\'d like to be doing right now\\nOK. (closes eyes) I\\'m in my apartment..\\n....yeah... what else\\nThat\\'s it.

Now tell me you want to caress my butt\\nOK, turn around. (Joey looks taken aback) I just don\\'t want you staring at me when I\\'m doing this\\n(turning around) Alright, alright. I\\'m around. Go ahead\\nAhem... I want.... OK, I want to... feel your... hot, soft skin with my lips\\nThere you go! Keep going. Keep going\\nI, er..\\nI want to take my tongue... and..\\n....and...\\nSay it... say it\\n...run it all over your body until you\\'re... trembling with... with..\\n(smiling)....with?\\n(rushing to explain) Funny story\\nYou\\'re not going to believe this\\nIt\\'s OK.

(phone rings, he answers) Hello? (hands phone to Chandler) And again\\n(on phone) Hey Mr. Kostelic! How\\'s life on the fifteenth floor? (Listens) Yeah, I miss you too. (Listens) Yeah, it\\'s a lot less satisfying to steal pens from your own home, you know? (Listens) Well, that\\'s very generous (Listens) er, but look, this isn\\'t about the money. I need something that\\'s more than a job. I need something I can really care about.... (Listens) And that\\'s on top of the yearly bonus structure you mentioned earlier? (Listens) Look, Al, Al... I\\'m not playing hardball here, OK? This is not a negotiation, this is a rejection! (Listens) No! No! No, stop saying numbers! I\\'m telling you, you\\'ve got the wrong guy!

(he finishes)... ginger\\nWell, smack my ass and call me Judy! These are fantastic\\nI\\'m so glad you liked them\\nLike \\'em? I could eat a hundred of them\\nOh, well... um, that\\'s all there are of these. But in about eight and a half minutes, we\\'ll be serving some delicious onion tartlets\\nTartlets. Tartlets.

Have you seen a monkey\\nSaw Regis Philbin once..\\nOkay, thank you, Mr. Heckles\\nYou owe me a waffle\\n(On the phone) Okay, he\\'s a, he\\'s a black capuchian monkey with a white face... (Enter Ross) ...with, with Russian dressing and, and pickles on the side. Okay. Thanks\\nHey. How did, uh, how\\'d it go today\\nGreat! It went great. Really great. Hey, is that wine\\nYeah. You, uh, you want some\\nOh, I would love some. But y\\'know what? Y\\'know what? Let\\'s not drink it here. I\\'m feeling kinda crazy. You wanna go to Newark\\nUh, okay, yeah, we could do that, but before we head off to the murder capital of the North-East, I was, uh, kinda wanting to run something by you. Y\\'know how we were, uh, y\\'know, talking before about, uh, relationships and stuff\\nOh God, Ross, I cannot do this\\nOkay, quick and painful\\nOh God... Okay. Alright. Alright. Okay. Ross, please don\\'t hate me\\nOh, what? What-what\\nY\\'know Marcel\\n...Yeah\\nWell, I kind of... I kind of lost him\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, continued from earlier\\n(Angry) I- I- I ca- I can\\'t believe this. I mean, all I asked you to do was keep him in the apartment\\nNo, y\\'know what, I guess it\\'s partially my fault. Y\\'know, I shouldn\\'t\\'ve, uh, asked you to start off with a monkey. I should\\'ve started you off with like a pen or a pencil\\n(Tearfully) Ross, I\\'m doing everything that I can, I\\'ve got everybody looking for him, and I- (Door buzzer goes and she runs to get it) Oh! Who is it\\nAnimal Control\\nSee? I\\'ve even called Animal Control\\nYou called Animal Control\\nUh-huh... why... do you not like them\\nMarcel is an illegal exotic animal. I\\'m not allowed to have him in the city. If they find him, they\\'ll take him away from me\\nO-okay, now see, you never ever ever told us that..\\nThat\\'s right, I.. \\'cause I didn\\'t expect you were gonna invite them to the apartment\\nHi, thanks for coming\\n(Animal Control) Somebody called about a monkey\\nOh, y\\'know what? That was a complete misunderstanding\\nYeah, we thought we had a monkey, but we-we didn\\'t\\nTurned out it was a hat\\nCat\\nCat! What\\'m I saying? Cat\\nHi. We checked the third and fourth floor, no-one\\'s seen Marcel\\nMarcel\\nMy uncle Marcel\\nOh, is that who the monkey\\'s named after\\nOookay. Are you aware that possession of an illegal exotic is, uh, punishable by up to two years in prison and confiscation of the animal\\nOh my God. You\\'d put that poor little creature in jail\\nPheebs, you remember how we talked about saying things quietly to yourself first\\nYes, but there isn\\'t always time\\nLook. I\\'m sure there\\'s some friendly way to reconcile this! Um, have a seat. First of all, we haven\\'t been introduced, I\\'m Monica Geller\\nOh my God, you are! And you\\'re Rachel Green\\nYeah\\nLuisa Gianetti! Lincoln High? I sat behind you guys in home room\\nLuisa? Oh my God! Monica! It\\'s Luisa\\nThe Luisa from home room\\nYes!\\nYou have no idea who I am, do you\\nNo, none at all\\nNone\\nWell, maybe that\\'s because you spent four years ignoring me. I mean, would it have been so hard to say \\'Morning, Luisa\\'? Or \\'Nice overalls\\'\\nOh, I\\'m- I\\'m so sorry\\nAh, it\\'s not so much you, you were fat, you had your own problems. (To Rachel) But you? What a bitch\\nWhat?\\nBe that as it may, d\\'you think you could just help us out here on that monkey thing? Y\\'know, just for old times\\' sake? Go Bobcats\\nI could... but I won\\'t. If I find that monkey, he\\'s mine\\nDun-dun-duuuur! Sorry\\nMarcel\\nMarcel\\nMarcel\\nMarcel\\nHi, can I help you\\nUm, we\\'re kind of having an emergency and we-we were looking for something..\\nA monkey\\nYes have you seen any\\nNo. No, haven\\'t seen a monkey. Do you know anything about fixing radiators\\nUm, sure! Did you, uh, did you try turning the knob back the other way\\nOf course\\nOh. Then, no\\nDid I put too much rum in here\\nJust a sec. (To Chandler and Joey) Hope you find your monkey\\nOh, nononowaitwaitwaitnono! Uh... we may not know anything about radiators per se, but we do have a certain amount of expertise in the heating and cooling... mileu\\nUh, aren\\'t we kind of in the middle of something here\\nYes, but these women are very hot, and they need our help! And they\\'re very hot\\nWe can\\'t, alright? (To the women) We\\'re sorry. You have no idea how sorry, but... We promised we\\'d find this monkey. If you see him, he\\'s about yea high and answers to the name Marcel, so if we could get some pictures of you, you\\'d really be helping us out\\nOkay, from now on, you don\\'t get to talk to other people\\nMarcel\\nMarcel?\\nMarcel\\nMarcel\\nMarcel\\nMarcel\\nOh-my-God\\nWhaaat\\nSomething just brushed up against my right leg\\nWhat is it\\nOh, it\\'s okay, it was just my left leg\\nLook, Phoebe\\nYeah! Oh, c\\'mere, Marcel! Oh, Marcel, c\\'mere\\nStep aside, ladies\\nWhat\\'re you gonna do\\nJust a small tranquiliser\\nRun, Marcel, run! Run, Marcel! (Marcel runs off and Luisa runs after him. Monica goes to check up on Phoebe) Are you okay\\nYeah, think so. Oh! (She notices the tranquiliser dart has hit her in the butt and removes it) Huh. (Sways back) Whoah\\nOh gosh\\nMarcel\\nMarcel\\nMarc- oh, this is ridiculous! We\\'ve been all over the neighbourhood. He\\'s gone, he\\'s-he\\'s just gone\\nRoss, you don\\'t know that\\nOh come on. It\\'s cold, it\\'s dark, he doesn\\'t know the Village. (Kicks a sign in frustration) And now I have a broken foot. I have no monkey, and a broken foot! Thank you very much\\nRoss, I said I\\'m sorry like a million times. What do you want me to do? You want me to break my foot too? Okay, I\\'m gonna break my foot, right here. (Kicks the sign) Ow!! Oh! Oh my God, oh my God! There, are you happy now?\\nYeah, yeah. Y\\'know, now that you kicked the sign, hey! I don\\'t miss Marcel any more\\nY\\'know, it is not like I did this on purpose\\nOh, no no no. Nono, this is just vintage Rachel. I mean, things just sort of happen around you. I mean, you\\'re off in Rachel-land, doing your Rachel-thing, totally oblivious to people\\'s monkeys, or to people\\'s feelings..\\nRoss\\nI don\\'t even wanna hear it, you\\'re just..\\nRoss\\nOh, forget it, okay\\nRoss\\nWhat? What\\nHey! Hey, Bananaman\\nEveryone in the hall outside Mr. Heckles\\' door. Ross is carrying the box of bananas\\nOh, this is so intense. One side of my butt is totally asleep, and the other side has no idea\\nHi, did you order some bananas\\nWhat about it\\nGimme back my monkey\\nI don\\'t have a monkey\\nThen what\\'s with all the bananas\\nPotassium\\nMarcel? Marcel? Okay, where is he? Where is he? Marcel? Marcel\\nMarcel! What\\'ve you done to him\\nThat\\'s my monkey. That\\'s Patti, Patti the monkey\\nAre you insane? C\\'mere, Marcel, c\\'mon\\nC\\'mere, Patti\\nC\\'mere, Marcel\\nC\\'mere, Patti. (Turns to Mr\\n(Out of shot) Here, monkey. Here, monkey! Here, monkey! (Marcel runs to the door and into Luisa\\'s cage, which she slams shut) Gotcha\\nOkay, gimme my monkey back\\nThat\\'s my monkey\\nYou\\'re both gonna have to take this up with the judge\\nThat\\'s not my monkey. Just the dress is mine, you can send that back whenever\\nAlright, I want my monkey\\nNo\\nOh, c\\'mon, Luisa\\nSorry, prom queen\\n(To Rachel) You had to be a bitch in high school, you couldn\\'t\\'ve been fat\\nAlright. In high school I was the prom queen and I was the homecoming queen and the class president and you... were also there! But if you take this monkey, I will lose one of the most important people in my life. You can hate me if you want, but please do not punish him. C\\'mon, Luisa, you have a chance to be the bigger person here! Take it\\nNope\\nAlright. Well then how about I call your supervisor, and I tell her that you shot my friend in the ass with a dart\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s. Rachel and Ross are there. Ross is trying to get the dress off Marcel\\nIt\\'ll be nice to get this off finally, won\\'t it? Yes it will. (Marcel resists) Or we can leave it on for now, that\\'s fine\\nY\\'know, with the right pair of pumps, that would be a great little outfit\\nListen, I\\'m- I\\'m sorry I was so hard on you before, it\\'s just I..\\nOh, Ross, c\\'mon. It\\'s my fault, I almost lost your..\\nYeah, but you were the one who got him back, y\\'know? You, you were great. ...Hey, we uh, we still have that, uh, that bottle of wine. You in the mood for, uh, something grape\\nThat\\'d be good\\nAlright. (He goes to get the glasses. Then he hesitates and turns off the main light. Rachel looks round and he acts surprised) The, uh, the neighbours must be vacuuming. (He sits down and starts to pour the wine) Well, so long as we\\'re here and, uh, not on the subject, I was thinking about, uh, how mad we got at each other before, and, um, I was thinking maybe it was partially because of how we, um..\\nRachel\\nBarry?\\nI can\\'t. I can\\'t do it, I can\\'t marry Mindy. I think I\\'m still in love with you\\nOh\\nWe have got to start locking that door\\nThis is me in The Sound of Music. See the von Trapp kids\\nNope\\nThat\\'s because I\\'m in front of them\\nEh. I thought that was an alp\\nWell, high school was not my favourite time\\nI dunno, I loved high school. Y\\'know? It was just four years of parties and dating and sex\\nYeah, well I went to boarding school with four hundred boys. Any sex I had would\\'ve involved a major lifestyle choice\\nGosh, doesn\\'t it seem like a million years ago\\nOh. Oooh! Ooh! Ooh! (She stands up and starts to dance around) Ooh! My butt cheek is waking up! Oooh! Ooh\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, everyone is there\\nI can\\'t believe you would actually say that. I would much rather be Mr.Peanut than Mr.Salty\\nNo way! Mr.Salty is a sailor, all right, he\\'s got to be, like, thetoughest snack there is\\nI don\\'t know, you don\\'t wanna mess with corn nuts. They\\'re craaazy\\n(looking out of the window) Oh my God. You guys! You gotta come see this! There\\'s some creep out there with a telescope\\nI can\\'t believe it! He\\'s looking right at us\\nOh, that is so sick\\nI feel violated. And not in a good way\\nHow can people do that?... (All but Phoebe walk away from the window in disgust.) Oh, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots\\nCentral Perk, everyone but Rachel is there\\nI am telling you, years from now, schoolchildren will study it as one of the greatest first dates of all time. It was unbelievable! We could totally be ourselves, we didn\\'t have to play any games..\\nSo have you called her yet\\nLet her know I like her? What are you, insane? (The girls make disgusted noises.) It\\'s the next day! How needy do I want to seem? (To the guys) I\\'m right, right\\nOh, yeah. Yeah. Let her dangle\\nI can\\'t believe my parents are actually pressuring me to find one of you people\\nOh, God, just do it! (Grabbing the phone.) Call her! Stop being so testosteroney\\nWhich, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat. (Calls her, then hurriedly hangs up.) I got her machine\\nHer answer machine\\nNo, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up\\nSo, uh, why didn\\'t you say anything\\nOh, no-no-no-no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up using the phrase \"Yes indeedy-o\\nLook look! It\\'s Rachel and Barry. No, don\\'t everybody look at once\\nOkay, okay, what\\'s going on\\nOkay, they\\'re just talking..\\nYeah, well, does he look upset? Does he look like he was just told to shove anything\\nNo, no actually, he\\'s smiling.. and... Oh my God, don\\'t do that!\\nWhat? What? What?\\nThat man across the street just kicked that pigeon! (Rachel enters.) Oh\\n(bluffing) And basically, that\\'s how a bill becomes a law\\nOh!... Right\\nHey Rach\\nHow\\'d it go\\nY\\'know, it was, uh.. it was actually really great. He took me to lunch at the Russian Tea Room, and I had that chicken, where y\\'know you poke it and all the butter squirts out..\\nNot a good day for birds..\\nThen we took a walk down to Bendall\\'s, and I told him not to, but he got me a little bottle of Chanel..\\nThat\\'s nice... now, was that before or after you told him to stop calling, stop sending you flowers and to generally leave you alone, hmm\\nRight,.. well,.. we never actually got to that... Oh, it was just so nice to see him again, y\\'know? It was comfortable, it was familiar... it was just nice\\nThat\\'s, that\\'s nice twice\\nRachel, what\\'s going on? I mean isn\\'t this the same Barry who you left at the altar\\nDuh, where\\'ve you been\\nYeah, but it was different with him today! And he wasn\\'t, like, Orthodontist Guy, y\\'know? I mean, we had fun! Is there anything wrong with that\\nYes\\nWhy\\nI have my reasons\\nOkay, how about the fact that he\\'s engaged to another woman, who just happens to be your ex-best friend\\nAll right. All right, all right, all right, all right, I know it\\'s stupid! I will go see him this afternoon, and I will just put an end to it\\nBarry\\'s Office, the post-coital Barry and Rachel are recovering on the chair\\nWow... Wow\\nYeah\\nI\\'m not crazy, right? I mean, it was never like that\\nNooo, it wasn\\'t\\nOoh, and it\\'s so nice having this little sink here..\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, everyone is there except Rachel\\n(on phone, reading from a script) Oh, Danielle! I wasn\\'t expecting the machine... Give me a call when you get a chance. (Rattles some dishes) Bye-bye. (Hangs up.) Oh God\\nThat\\'s what you\\'ve been working on for the past two hours?\\nHey, I\\'ve been honing\\nWhat was with the dishes\\nOh, uh.. I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y\\'know? I might have some kind of life, like I haven\\'t been sitting around here honing for the past few hours\\n(looking out the window) Look look! He\\'s doing it again, the guy with the telescope\\nOh my God! (Walks to the window) Go away! (Gesturing.) Stop looking in here\\nGreat, now he\\'s waving back\\nMan, we gotta do something about that guy. This morning, I caught him looking into our apartment. It creeps me out! I feel like I can\\'t do stuff\\nWhat kinda stuff\\nWill you grow up? I\\'m not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when I\\'m cooking naked\\nYou cook naked\\nYeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters\\nWhat are you looking at me for? I didn\\'t know that\\nBarry\\'s Office, Rachel and Barry are getting dressed\\nWhat\\'s the matter\\nOh, it\\'s just... Oh, Barry, this was not good\\nNo, it was. It was very very good\\nWell, what about Mindy\\nOh, way, way better than Mindy\\nNo, not that, I mean, what about you and Mindy\\nWell, if you want, I\\'ll justÑI\\'ll just break it off with her\\nNo. No-no-no-no, no. I mean, don\\'t do that. Not, I mean not for me\\n(over intercom) Dr. Farber, Bobby Rush is here for his adjustment\\n(into intercom) Thanks, Bernice. (To Rachel) Let\\'s go away this weekend\\nOh, Barry..! Come on, this is all way too.\\nWe can, we can go to Aruba! When I went there on what would have been our honeymoon, it was, uh... it was really nice. You would\\'ve liked it\\nI had a bra\\nHey, Dr. Farber\\nAll right Miss Green, everything looks fine... Yep, I think we\\'re starting to see some real progress here\\nWhat?\\nI\\'m twelve, I\\'m not stupid\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, Chandler enters clutching his phone\\nCan I use your phone\\nYeah.. uh, but for future reference, that thing in your hand can also be used as a phone\\nYes, it\\'s working! Why isn\\'t she calling me back\\nMaybe she never got your message\\nY\\'know, if you want, you can call her machine, and if she has a lot of beeps, that means she probably didn\\'t get her messages yet\\nY\\'don\\'t think that makes me seem a little..\\n...desperate, needy, pathetic\\nAh, you obviously saw my personal ad\\nHow many beeps\\nShe answered\\nY\\'see, this is where you\\'d use that \\'hello\\' word we talked about\\nI\\'m not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me. Now I\\'m needy and snubbed. God, I miss just being needy\\nHey! Hi\\nHow\\'d he take it\\nPretty well, actually... (Wandering into the kitchen\\n(wandering in after her) Uh, Rach... how come you have dental floss in your hair\\nOh, do I\\nUh huh\\n(in a low voice) We ended up having sex in his chair\\nYou had sex in his chair?!... I said that a little too loudly, didn\\'t I\\nYou-you had what\\nSex in his chair\\nWhat, uh... what were you thinking\\nI don\\'t know! I mean, we still care about each other. There\\'s a history there. \\'S\\'like you and Carol\\nNo! No no, it is nothing like me and Carol\\nPlease. If she said to you, \"Ross, I want you on this couch, right here, right now,\" what would you say\\nIf it helps, I could slide over\\nIt\\'s, it\\'s, it\\'s, uh, a totally diferent situation! It\\'s, it\\'s apples and oranges, it\\'s, it\\'s orthodontists and lesbi- I gotta go\\nWhere are you going\\n(leaving) I just have to go, all right? Do I need a reason? Huh? I mean I have things to do with my life, I have a jam packed schedule, and I am late- for keeping up with it. Okay\\nHello? Hello\\n(on phone) Hello?(Listens) Mindy! Hi! Hey, how are you? (Listens) Yes, yes, I\\'ve heard, congratulations, that is so great. (Listens) Really? (Listens) Oh. (Listens) Okay.

(Listens) All right, so I\\'ll, so I\\'ll see you tomorrow! (Listens) Okay.. (Listens) Okay... (Listens) Bye. (Hangs up and sits down heavily.) Oh God. Oh God. Oh God\\nSo how\\'s Mindy\\nOh, she wants to see me tomorrow...Oh, she sounded really weird, I gotta call Barry... (Does so, on phone) Hi, it\\'s me, I just.. Mindy!! Mindy! Hi! No, I figured that\\'s where you\\'d be\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, the next morning.Ê Chandler is sitting and staring at his phone.Ê Monica enters and creeps up next to Chandler\\nBrrrrrrr\\nHell is filled with people like you\\n(entering) He\\'s back! The peeper\\'s back\\n(ducking) Get down\\nGet down\\n...And boogie\\nThanks, but I gotta go to work and get my eyes scratched out by Mindy\\nRelax. Y\\'know, she may not even know\\nPlease. I haven\\'t heard from her in seven months, and now she calls me? I mean, what else is it about? Oh! She was my best friend, you guys! We went to camp together... she taught me how to kiss.\\n(intrigued) Yeah\\nAnd now, y\\'know, I\\'m like... I\\'m like the other woman! I feel so.\\n..Naughty\\nRight, I\\'ll see you guys later..\\nOh, hold up, I\\'ll walk out with you. Now, Rach, when she taught you to kiss, you were at camp, and.. were you wearing any kinda little uniform, or- (Rachel exits and slams the door in his face.) That\\'s fine, yeah..\\nOkay, I\\'m gonna go to the bathroom. Will you watch my phone\\nWhy don\\'t you just take it with you\\nHey, we haven\\'t been on a second date, she needs to hear me pee\\nWhy don\\'t you just call her\\nI can\\'t call her, I left a message! I have some pride\\nDo you\\nNo! (Calls) Danielle, hi! It\\'s, uh, it\\'s Chandler! (Listens) I\\'m fine. Uh, listen, I don\\'t know if you tried to call me, because, uh, idiot that I am, I accidentally shut off my phone. (Listens) Oh, uh, okay, that\\'s fine, that\\'s great. (Listens) Okay. (Puts down the phone.) (to Monica) She\\'s on the other line, she\\'s gonna call me back. (He starts doing a little jig.) She\\'s on the other line, she\\'s gonna call me back, she\\'s on the other line, gonna call me back..\\nDon\\'t you have to pee\\n\\'S\\'why I\\'m dancing..\\nCentral Perk, Rachel is serving coffee as Mindy enters\\nMindy\\nHey, you\\nHey, you.... So, what\\'s up\\nUm.. we should really be sitting for this\\nSure we should... So\\nNow, I know things\\'ve been weird lately, but you\\'re like my oldest friend in the world... Except for maybe Laurie Schaffer, who I don\\'t talk to anywhere, \\'cause she\\'s all bitter now that she lost the weight and it turns out she doesn\\'t have a pretty face. ....Okay, I\\'m just gonna ask you this once, and I want a straight answer\\nOkay\\nWill you be my maid of honour\\nOf course\\nOh that\\'s so great\\nWas that all you wanted to ask me\\nThat\\'s all\\nOhhhh!! (Mindy starts to sob.) ...What? What\\nThat\\'s not all\\nOh sure it is\\nOh no, it isn\\'t! No! I think Barry is seeing someone in the city\\nUm, what- what would make you think that\\nWell, ever since we announced the engagement, he\\'s been acting really weird, and then last night, he came home smelling like Chanel\\n(draws back) Really. Mindy, if it\\'ll make you feel any better, when I was engaged to him he went through a whole weird thing too\\nOh God! You see, that\\'s what I was afraid of\\nWhat? What\\'s what you were afraid of\\nOkay, okay... when Barry was engaged to you, he and I...kind of... had a little thing on the side\\nWhat\\nI know. I know, and when he proposed to me, everyone said \"Don\\'t do it, he\\'s just gonna do to you what he did to Rachel,\" and now I feel so stupid\\nUh... Oh, Mindy, you are so stupid. Oh, we are both so stupid\\nWhat do you mean\\n(offers her arm to Mindy and she sniffs) Smell familiar\\nOh no\\nOh, I am so sorry\\nNo me, I am so sorry..\\n(watches them for a while) Oh my\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, Phoebe and Ross are doing a crossword, Monica is cooking, and Chandler is still staring at his phone\\nFour letters: \"Circle or hoop\"\\nRing dammit, ring\\nThanks\\n(entering) Hey, you know our phone\\'s not working\\nWhat?\\nI tried to call you from the coffee shop, and there was no answer\\n(investigating) I turned it off. Mother of God, I turned it off\\nJust like you told her you did! (Chandler glares at her.) ... Just pointing out the irony\\nHey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman- I got the peeper\\'s name! Can I use the phone\\nNngghhh!!!!!!\\n(to Monica) Can I use your phone? (On phone) Yeah, the number for a Sidney Marks, please\\n\"Heating device\\nRadiator\\nFive letters\\nRdtor\\n(on phone) Yeah, is Sidney there? (Listens) Oh, this is? (To the gang) Sidney\\'s a woman\\nSo she\\'s a woman! So what\\nYeah. Yeah, so what? (On phone) Look, I live across the street, (walking to the window) and I know all about you and your little telescope, and I don\\'t appreciate it, okay? (Listens) Yeah, I can see you right now! (Listens) Hello! (Listens) If I wanna walk around my apartment in my underwear, I shouldn\\'t have to feel likeÑ(Listens)ÑThank you, but... that\\'s not really the point... (Listens) The point is that... (Listens) Mostly free weights, but occasionally.\\nJoey!\\n(on phone) Yeah, my neighbor... (Listens) Yeah, the brunette... (to Monica) She says you looked very pretty the other day in the green dress\\nThe green dress? Really\\nYeah, she said you looked like Ingrid Bergman that day\\n(waves dismissively to Sidney) Nooo\\nBarry\\'s Office, Barry is preparing his tools alone as Rachel enters\\nHey. Got a second\\nSure, sure. Come on... (Mindy enters) ...in..\\nHello, sweetheart\\nUh... uh... what\\'re\\'you... what\\'re\\'you guys doing here\\nUh, we are here to break up with you\\nBoth of you\\nBasically, we think you\\'re a horrible human being, and bad things should happen to you\\nI\\'m sorry... I\\'m sorry, God, I am so sorry, I\\'m an idiot, I was weak, I couldn\\'t help myself! Whatever I did, I only did because I love you so much\\nUh- which one of us are you talking to there, Barr\\n....Mindy. Mindy, of course Mindy, it was always Mindy\\nEven when we were having sex in that chair\\n(to Mindy) I swear, whatever I was doing, I was always thinking of you\\nPlease! During that second time you couldn\\'t have picked her out of a lineup\\n(to Rachel) You did it twice\\nWell, the first time didn\\'t really count... I mean, y\\'know, \\'s\\'Barry\\nOkay..\\n(to Mindy) Sweetheart, just gimme- gimme another chance, okay, we\\'ll start all over again. We\\'ll go back to Aruba\\n(over intercom) Dr. Farber, we\\'ve got a bit of an emergency here...Jason Costalano is choking on his retainer\\nOh God... (Into intercom) I\\'ll be right there, Bernice. (to Mindy) Look, please, please don\\'t go anywhere, okay? I\\'ll be, I\\'ll be right back\\nOkay. Okay, we\\'ll be here! Hating you! Did you see how he was sweating when he walked out of there? Listen honey, if I\\'m hogging the ball too much you just jump right in there and take a couple punches because I\\'m telling you, this feels great\\nYeah... I\\'m pretty sure I\\'m still gonna marry him\\nWhat are you talking about?! Mindy, the guy is the devil! He\\'s Satan in a smock\\nLook, I know he\\'s not perfect, but the truth is, at the end of the day, I still really wanna be Mrs. Dr. Barry Farber, D.D.S\\nOh God\\nI hope you can find some way to be happy for me. And I hope you\\'ll still be my maid of honor...\\nAnd I hope Barry doesn\\'t kill you and eat you in Aruba\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, Monica and Rachel are there\\nYou okay\\nYeah\\nReally\\nYeah! Y\\'know, ever since I ran out on Barry at the wedding, I have wondered whether I made the right choice. And now I know\\nAww..\\nBig day\\nCentral Perk, everyone is there\\nAll right, I\\'ll give you this, Mr. Peanut is a better dresser. I mean he\\'s got the monocle, he\\'s got the top hat..\\nYou know he\\'s gay\\nI just wanna clarify this: are you outing Mr. Peanut\\n(entering) Chandler\\nDanielle! Hi! Uh- everybody, this is Danielle, Danielle, everybody\\nHi. Hi\\nWhat are you doing here\\nWell, I\\'ve been calling you, but it turns out I had your number wrong. And when I finally got the right one from Information, there was no answer. So I thought I\\'d just come down here, and make sure you were okay\\n...I\\'m, I\\'m okay\\nListen uh, maybe we could get together later\\nThat sounds good. I\\'ll call you- or you call me, whatever..\\nYou got it\\nOkay\\nG\\'bye, everybody\\nBye\\nWhoo-hoo\\nYeah, there you go\\nSecond date\\n...I dunno\\nYou don\\'t know?\\nWell, she seems very nice and everything, but that whole thing about her coming all the way down here, just to see if I was okay? I mean,... how needy is that\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, everyone is looking at papers\\nHow could someone get a hold of your credit card number\\nI have no idea. But look how much they spent\\nMonica, would you calm down? The credit card people said that you only have to pay for the stuff that you bought\\nI know. It\\'s just such reckless spending\\nI think when someone steals your credit card, they\\'ve kind of already thrown caution to the wind\\nWow, what a geek. They spent $69.95 on a Wonder Mop\\nThat\\'s me\\nOh! The yuk! Ross, he\\'s doing it again\\nMarcel, stop humping the lamp! Stop humping\\nOh no, not in my room! I\\'ll get him\\nRoss, you\\'ve got to do something about the humping\\nWhat? It\\'s, it\\'s just a phase\\nWell, that\\'s what we said about Joey..\\nWould you all relax? It\\'s not that big a deal\\n(Out of shot) Stop it! Marcel! Bad monkey\\nWhat\\nLet\\'s just say my Curious George doll is no longer curious\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, late at night Monica is still examining her bill as Rachel emerges from her room\\nOh, Monica. You are not still going over that thing\\nThis woman\\'s living my life\\nWhat\\nShe\\'s living my life, and she\\'s doing it better than me! Look at this, look. She buys tickets for plays that I wanna see. She, she buys clothes from stores that I\\'m intimidated by the sales people. She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies\\nYou\\'re not an artist\\nYeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all this stuff. Only I don\\'t\\nOh, Monica, c\\'mon, you do cool things\\nOh really? Okay, let\\'s compare, shall we\\n(Yawning) Oh, it\\'s so late for \\'Shall we\\'..\\nDo I go horseback riding in the park? Do I take classes at the New School\\n(Yawning) Nooo..\\nThis is so unfair! She\\'s got everything I want, and she doesn\\'t have my mother\\nCentral Perk, Joey and Chandler are discussing stage names\\nHow about Joey... Pepponi\\nNo, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that\\'s more neutral\\nJoey... Switzerland\\nPlus, y\\'know, I think it should be Joe. Y\\'know, Joey makes me sound like I\\'m, I dunno, this big. (Waitress looks at him funny) Which I\\'m not\\nJoe...Joe...Joe...Stalin\\nStalin...Stalin...do I know that name? It sounds familiar\\nWell, it does not ring a bell with me..\\n(Writes it down) Joe Stalin. Y\\'know, that\\'s pretty good\\nMight wanna try Joseph\\nJoseph Stalin. I think you\\'d remember that\\nOh yes! Bye Bye Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin. Joseph Stalin is the Fiddler on the Roof\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, Monica is there as Phoebe and Rachel enter\\nHey\\nHey\\nHi. (On the phone) Hi, uh, yes, this is Monica Geller. Um, I believe I\\'m taking some classes with you and I was wondering what they were\\nWhat are you doing\\n(Hushes her) Alright, great. Thanks a lot. (Hangs up) I\\'m going to tap class\\nWhat, what, so that you can dance with the woman that stole your credit card\\nThis woman\\'s got my life, I should get to see who she is\\nGo to the post office! I\\'m sure her picture\\'s up! ...Okay, Monica, y\\'know what, honey, you\\'re kinda losing it here! I mean, this is really becoming like a weird obsession thing\\nThis is madness. It\\'s madness, I tell you, for the love of God, Monica, don\\'t do it!! ...Thank you\\nA Tap Class, the girls are standing at the door\\nWhat d\\'you think\\nLotsa things\\nWhich one do you think she is\\nMay I help you\\nOh, no thanks, we\\'re just here to observe\\nYou don\\'t observe a dance class. You dance a dance class. Spare shoes are over there\\nWhat does she mean\\nI think she means (Imitates) \\'You dance a dance class\\'. Oh, c\\'mon, c\\'mon\\nOkay, d\\'y\\'see anybody you think could be me\\n(To the class) People! Last time there were some empty yoghurt containers lying around after class. Let\\'s not have that happen again\\nShe could be you\\nLet\\'s get started. Five, six, a-five six seven eight..\\nOkay, I\\'m not getting this\\n(Dancing in a swirly, Phoebe kind of way) I\\'m totally getting it\\nDid you ever feel like sometimes you are just so unbelievably uncoordinated\\nWhat? You just click when they click\\nAlright people, now everyone grab a partner\\nOkay. And, my, dead, mother, says, you, are, it. I\\'m with Rachel\\nGreat. It\\'s gym class all over again\\nAww\\nWell that\\'s all right, you can come up to the front and dance with me\\nWhy don\\'t I just take off my clothes and have a nightmare\\nIt\\'s okay, it\\'s okay, I\\'m here, I\\'m here. Sorry I\\'m late, okay, here I am. Who\\'s the new tense girl\\nShe\\'s your partner\\nHi. I\\'m Monica\\nOh. Monica! ...Hi. I\\'m Mo- ...nana\\n(Fake Monica) Monana\\nYeah. It\\'s Dutch\\nYou\\'re kidding! I-I spent three years in Amsterdam\\nUm, Pennsylvania Dutch\\nAnd we\\'re dancing. A-five, six, seven, eight..\\nCentral Perk, Ross is entering\\n(Mortified) Hi\\nHey\\nWhere\\'ve you been\\nAt the vet\\nShe\\'s not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she\\nShe says Marcel\\'s humping thing\\'s not a phase. Apparently he\\'s reached sexual maturity\\n(To Chandler) Hey! He beat ya\\nShe says as time goes on, he\\'s gonna start getting agressive and violent\\nSo what does this mean\\nI\\'m gonna have to give him up\\nCentral Perk, scene continued from earlier.Ê They guys are sitting there like the Three Monkeys\\nI can\\'t believe it, Ross. This sucks\\nI don\\'t get it, I mean, you just got him. How can he be an adult already\\nI know. I know. I mean, one day, he\\'s this little thing, and before you know it, he\\'s this little thing I can\\'t get off my leg\\nIsn\\'t there any way you can keep him\\nNo, no. The vet says unless he\\'s in a place where he has regular access to some... monkey lovin,\\' he\\'s just gonna get vicious. I\\'ve just gotta get him into a zoo\\nHow do you get a monkey into a zoo\\nI know that one! ...No, that\\'s Popes into a Volkswagen\\nWell, we\\'re applying to a lot of them. Naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos, y\\'know, like, uh, San Diego... right? But that might just be a pipe dream, because, y\\'know, he\\'s out of state. Uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at Miami, so that\\'s a possibility\\nYeah, but that\\'s like two blocks away from the beach. I mean, it\\'s a total party zoo\\nHey. We found her, we found the girl\\nWhat\\nDid you call the cops\\nNope. We took her to lunch\\nAh. Your own brand of vigilante justice\\nWhat?! Are you insane? This woman stole from you. She stole. She\\'s a stealer\\nY\\'know what? After you\\'re with this woman for like ten minutes, you forget all that. I mean, she is this astounding person, with this, with this amazing spirit\\nYeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader\\n...Take off their hats\\nPopes in a Volkswagen! ...I love that joke\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, Monica, Rachel and Fake Monica are there\\nNo way. No way did you do this\\nMonana was very brave\\nIt was so wild. We told them we were the Gunnersens in room six fifteen. Only to find out the Boston Celtics had taken over the entire sixth floor\\nSo once they caught on to the fact that we\\'re, y\\'know, short and have breasts..\\n...They threw us out! I was thrown out of a hotel! Me\\nGo Monana! Well, you ladies are not the only ones living the dream. I get to go pour coffee for people I don\\'t know. Don\\'t wait up\\nOh, by the way, tomorrow we\\'re auditioning for a Broadway show\\n\\'Scuse me\\nThere\\'s an open call for Cats. I\\'m thinking we go down there, sing Memories and make complete fools of ourselves. Whaddya say\\nNononononono. Think who you\\'re dealing with here. I mean, I\\'m not like you. I-I can\\'t even stand in front of a tap class\\nWell, that\\'s just probably \\'cause of your Amish background\\nWhat\\nWell, you\\'re Pennsylvania Dutch, right\\nRight. Till I bought a blow dryer, then I was shunned\\nI-I used to be just like you. And then one day I saw a movie that changed my life. Did you ever see Dead Poets\\' Society\\nUh-huh\\nI thought that movie was so incredibly... boring. I mean, that thing at the end where the kid kills himself because he can\\'t be in the play? What was that?! It\\'s like, kid, wait a year, leave home, do some community theatre. I walked out of there and I thought, \\'Now, that\\'s two hours of my life that I\\'m never getting back.\\' And that thought scared me more than all the other crap I was afraid to do\\nWow. Then I would definitely not recommend Mrs. Doubtfire\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, tiem lapse.Ê Everyone but Joey and Monica are there\\n(Reading letters) Oh God. (To Marcel) We didn\\'t get into Scranton. (To the others) That was like our safety zoo. They take like dogs and cows. See? I don\\'t know who this is harder on, me or him\\nI\\'d say that chair\\'s taking the brunt\\nMarcel! Marcel! Marcel, no! Good boy. See, how can nobody want him\\nOh, somebody will\\n(entering) You know there already is a Joseph Stalin\\nYou\\'re kidding\\nApparently he was this Russian dictator who slaughtered all these people. You\\'d think you would\\'ve known that\\nY\\'know, you\\'d think I would\\'ve\\nPhoebe. Whaddyou think a good stage name for me would be\\n...Flame Boy\\nCentral Perk, Ross is talking to Dr. Baldhara, a zookeeper\\nWhere exactly is your zoo\\nWell, it\\'s technically not a zoo per se, it\\'s more of an interactive wildlife experience. Let me ask you some questions about, is it, uh, Marcel\\nYes\\nDoes he, uh, fight with other animals\\nNo-no, he\\'s, he\\'s very docile\\nEven if he were... cornered\\nWell I, I don\\'t know. Why\\nUh, how is he at handling small objects\\nHe can hold a banana, if that\\'s whatcha mean..\\nHow about a hammer, or a small blade\\nWhy- why- why would he need a blade\\nWell, if he\\'s up against a jungle cat or an animal with horns, you\\'ve got to give the little guy something. Otherwise it\\'s just cruel\\nHe- he- he got in, he- he got in to San Diego\\nWe, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing..\\n...He\\'s in\\nHe\\'s in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego\\nYou\\'re making a big mistake here. I mean, San Diego\\'s all well and good, but if you give him to me, I\\'ll start him off against a blind rabbit and give you twenty percent of the gains\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, Rachel is dusting. She comes to the table, lifts all the magazines and wipes under them, then just puts them down again. Monica bursts in, obviously drunk\\nYo- hooo\\nWhere the hell\\'ve you been\\nMonica and I just crashed an embassy party\\nAre you drunk?\\nNoooo! (Comes closer and whispers) I\\'m lying. I am so drunk\\nOh God, oh. Great, Monica, y\\'know what, you could\\'ve called, I have been up here, I\\'ve been worried..\\nMonica? Monica\\nWater rules\\nYes, yes, it does. Okay, look, the restaurant called, they wanna know if you\\'re gonna be showing up for work\\nNope. Going to the Big Apple Circus today\\nOkay Monica, what are you doing? You\\'re gonna lose your job! This is not you\\nNo, it is me! Y\\'know, I\\'m not just the person who needs to fluff the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in! Y\\'know, when I\\'m with her, I am so much more than that. I\\'m- I\\'m Monana\\nHello? Yes, she is, hold on a second, please. Monana, it\\'s for you, the credit card people\\nHelloooo? Yeah. Oh my God. Thanks\\nWhat\\nThey\\'ve arrested Monica\\nNew York City Department of Correction, Monica is visiting Fake Monica\\nHi\\nHey\\nHow are you\\nI\\'m not too bad. Fortunately, blue\\'s my colour. How-how did you know I was here\\nBecause... I\\'m Monica Geller. It was my credit card you were using\\nThat I was not expecting\\nI want you to know, it wasn\\'t me who turned you in\\nOh. Thanks\\nNo, thank you! You have given me so much! I mean, if it wasn\\'t for you, I would never have gotten to sing Memories on the stage at the Wintergarden Theater\\nWell, actually, you only got to sing \\'Memo-\\'\\nI just can\\'t believe you\\'re in here. I mean, what am I gonna do without you? Who\\'s gonna crash the embassy parties with me? Who\\'s gonna take me to the Big Apple Circus\\nMonica, I started my day by peeing in front of twenty-five other women, and you\\'re worried about who\\'s gonna take you to the Big Apple Circus\\nWell, not... worried, just... wondering\\nThere\\'s nothing to wonder about, Monica. You\\'re gonna go back to being exactly who you were, because that\\'s who you are\\nNot necessarily..\\nYes necessarily! I mean, I dunno what it is, maybe it\\'s the Amish thing\\nUm, I\\'m not actually Amish\\nReally? Then why are you like that\\nTap Class, Monica is standing by the door\\nYou by the door. In or out\\nIn. (She joins in the dancing\\nYou in the back, you\\'re getting it all wrong\\nYeah, but at least I\\'m doing it\\nThe Airport, everyone but Monica is there to see off Marcel\\nThis is the final boarding call for flight 67 to San Diego, boarding at gate 42A\\nOkay. Good-bye, little monkey guy. Alright, I wrote you this poem. Okay, but don\\'t eat it \\'till you get on the plane\\nAww. Thank you, Aunt Phoebe\\nOh\\nOkay, bye, champ. Now, I know there\\'s gonna be a lot of babes in San Diego, but remember, there\\'s also a lot to learn\\nI dunno what to say, Ross. Uh, it\\'s a monkey\\nJust, just say what you feel\\nMarcel, I\\'m hungry\\nThat was good\\n(Brings Marcel a teddy bear) Marcel, this is for you. It\\'s, uh, just, y\\'know, something to, um, do on the plane\\nUh, if you guys don\\'t mind, I\\'d like to take a moment, just me and him\\nOh, sure. Sure, absolutely\\nMarcel, c\\'mere, c\\'mere. (He sits down and Marcel jumps down and sits beside him) Well buddy, this is it. There\\'s just a coupla things I want to say. I\\'m really gonna miss you, and I\\'m never gonna forget about you. You\\'ve been more than just a pet to me, you\\'ve been more like a be- (Marcel climbs down and starts humping his leg) Okay, Marcel, please, could you leave my leg alone? Could you just stop humping me for two seconds?! Marcel, would- okay, just take him away. Just take him\\nA Theater, there is a casting session going on for a play\\n(Very melodramatically, and very badly) Oh, that I were a glove upon that hand, that I might... touch thy cheek..\\nThat\\'s fine, thank you\\nNext\\nHi, uh, I\\'ll be reading for the role of Mercutio\\nName\\nHolden McGroin\\nCentral Perk. Everyone is there\\nTell him\\nNo\\nTell him, tell him\\nJust...please tell him\\nShut up\\nTell me what\\nLook at you, you won\\'t even look at him\\n(sarcastically) Oh, come on tell me. I could use another reason why women won\\'t look at me\\nAll right, all right, all right. Last night, I had a dream that, uh, you and I, were..\\nDoing it on this table\\nWow\\nExellent dream score\\nWhy, why, why would you dream that\\nMore importantly, was I any good\\nWell, you were pretty damn good\\nInteresting, cause in my dreams, I\\'m allways surprisingly inadequate\\nWell, last night you seemed to know your way around the table\\nI love it, when we share\\nYou\\'re okay there\\nI can\\'t belive you two had sex in her dream\\nI\\'m sorry, it was a one-time-thing. I was very drunk and i was somebody else\\'s subconscious\\nCentral Perk, continued from earlier, Chandler is sitting on the table\\nHello Rachel\\nGet off\\n(points at Joey\\'s pen) Uh, uh, gimme. Can you see me operating a drill press\\nI don\\'t know. What are you wearing\\nPheebs, why would you want to operate a drill press\\nJust for some short-term-work. You know, until I get back some of my massage clients\\nPirates again\\nNo, nothing like that. I was just...such a dummie. I taught this \"massage-yourself-at-home-workshop.\" And they are\\nHey, hey, Chan. She could work for you\\n(sarcasticly) Thanks Joey, that\\'s a good idea\\nWhat... I could, I could do it. What is it\\nWell, my secretary is gonna be out for a couple of weeks. She is having one of her boobs redused. (Ross looks at her.) It\\'s a whole big boob story\\nI could be a secretary\\nWell, you know Phoebs. I don\\'t know if it\\'s your kinda thing, because it involves a lot of being normal. For a large portion of the day\\nI could do that\\nWhat are you playing with\\nOh, it\\'s my new beeper\\nWhat the hell does a paleontologist need a beeper for\\nIs it like for dinosaur emergencies. \\'Help, come quick, they\\'re still extinct\\nNo, it\\'s for when Carol goes into labor.

(pause) No, belive me, you don\\'t want me. Judging by his number, I\\'d be a huge disappointment. (pause) All rightie, bye bye\\nHey, hey. How was the first day\\nOh, exellent. Everyone was so, so nice\\nSee, it pays to know the man who wears my shoes. (Joey and Ross wonder what he means) Me\\nNo, I didn\\'t tell anybody that I knew you\\nWhy not\\nOh, because, you know... they don\\'t like you\\nWhat?\\nI thought you knew that\\nNoho. Who doesn\\'t they like me\\nEveryone. Except for uh... no everyone\\nWhat are you talking about\\nDon\\'t feel bad. You know they used to like you a lot. But then you got promoted, and, you know, now you\\'re like \"Mr. Boss Man\". You know, Mr. Bing. Mr. Bing, \"Boss Man Bing\"\\nI can\\'t belive it\\nYeah, yeah.

Oh, shut up\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, Monica and Young Ethan are sitting in the couch\\nDid not\\nI am telling you, up until I was, like nine, I thought that gunpoint was an actual place where crimes happen\\nHow was that possible\\nWell, think about it. It\\'s always on the news. \\'A man is being held up, at gunpoint.\\' \\'Tourists are being terrorised, at gunpoint.\\' And I just kept thinking: why does people continue to go there? (He checks his watch.) Oh, ah. I should go\\nOkay\\nOkay\\nUnless..\\nWhat\\nUh, ah. Unless you wanna stay over? I mean, I\\'m going to, so..\\nYeah, I\\'d really like that\\nUuh, before we get into any staying-over-stuff, there is something you should know\\nOkay, is this like \\'I have an early class tomorrow\\' or \\'I\\'m secretly married to a goat\\nWell it\\'s somewhere in between. You see, in a strictly technical sense, of course, I\\'m not uh..., well I, I mean I haven\\'t ever uh..\\nEthan\\nYeah\\nAre you a virgin\\nWell, if that\\'s what you kids are calling it these days then, yes I am. I uh, I\\'ve kinda been waiting for the right person\\nReally\\nYeah. You do know I was talking about you, right\\nWow\\nYou keep saying that\\nYou know, you read about it, you see it in the movies. Even when you practice it at home, man oh man, it is nothing like that\\nListen, uh, you told me something that was really difficult for you. And I, I-I figured if you could be honest, then I can to\\nOh god, don\\'t tell me, I did it wrong\\nNo-no. Nothing wrong about that\\nOh\\nUm, okay, here it goes. I\\'m not 22. I\\'m, I\\'m 25... and thirteen months\\nHuh\\nBut I figured, you know, that shouldn\\'t change anything. I mean, what the hell does it matter how old we are\\nUh, listen um, as long as we\\'re telling stuff, uh, I have another one for you. I\\'m a little younger than I said\\nYou\\'re not a senior\\nOh, I\\'m a senior... in High School\\nOk...ay\\nMonica\\'s Bedroom, continued from earlier\\nWhat we did was wrong. Oh god, I just had sex with somebody that wasn\\'t alive during the Bicentennial\\nI just had sex\\nEthan, focus. How could you not tell me\\nWell, you never told me how old you were\\nWell, that\\'s different. My lie didn\\'t make one of us a felon in 48 states. What were you thinking\\nI wasn\\'t thinking. I was too busy fallin\\'..\\nDon\\'t say it\\n...in love with you\\nReally\\n(nods) Sorry\\nWell,fall out of it. You know, you shouldn\\'t even be here, it\\'s a school night. Oh god, oh god.

(to Phoebe) Just easier that way\\nOh, come on. You told me about the last dream\\nNo, forget it\\nOh, why not. Was I doing anything particularly... saucy\\nAll right, fine. Um, you were not the only one there. (Camera fades to Ross, who\\'s listening very carefully) Joey was there too\\nAll right. (Moves closer\\nWas there...uh, huh, huh, huh... andybody, anybody else there\\nNo\\nYou\\'re sure? Nobody uh, handed out uh, mints or anything\\nNo, it was just the three of us\\nHuh\\nSo, tell me. Was it like you and Chandler, and then you and me, or you and me and Chandler\\n(laughs) You know what\\nWhat\\nThere were times when it wasn\\'t even me\\nThat is so sweet, you guys\\nHey, Mon\\nMon, Ethan called again. Mon\\n(shouting) Mon\\nWhat\\nEthan called again\\nOh\\nAre you not seeing him anymore\\nNo. You know, sometimes just things doesn\\'t work out\\nAnd this has nothing to do with the fact that he needs a note to get out of gym\\nI, I didn\\'t say any... I sw... I did not say anything, I swear. He stopped by\\nListen, the next time you talk to him, can you ask him which one the strongest Power Ranger is\\nOh, yeah\\nHa,ha, ha, oh my life is just so amusing.

That\\'s a part of the whole, you know, them-not-liking-you-extravaganza\\nYou know, I don\\'t get this. A month ago, these people were my friends. You know, just because I\\'m in charge doesn\\'t mean I\\'m a different person\\nWell, then you should come tonight. You know, just hang out with them. Let them see what a great guy you still are\\nYou think I should\\nI really do, yeah\\nOkay\\nOkay\\nOkay\\nOh, but, could we not go together?

I can\\'t believe he remembered\\nWell, sure, but can you play it on a plane\\nOh, it\\'s so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune\\nI can\\'t believe he did this\\nCome on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck\\nWhat did you just say\\n(panicked) ahem... um... Crystal duck\\nNo, no, no.... the, um, the... \\'love\\' part\\n(stuttering incoherently) F-hah.... flennin...\\nOh.... my God\\n(rubbing his temples) Oh, no-no-no-no-no...\\n(pats Chandler on the leg) That\\'s good, just keep rubbing your head. That\\'ll turn back time\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, continued from earlier\\nI mean, this is unbelievable\\nI know. This is really, really huge\\nNo it\\'s not. It\\'s small. It\\'s tiny. It\\'s petite. It\\'s wee\\nNuh-uh. I don\\'t think any of our lives are ever gonna be the same ever again\\nOK, is there a mute button on this woman\\nI think this is so great! I mean, you and Ross! D-did you have any idea\\nNo! None! I mean, my first night in the city, he mentioned something about asking me out, but nothing ever happened, so I just... (to Joey): W-well, what else did he say? I mean, does he, like, want to go out with me\\nWell, given that he\\'s desperately in love with you, he probably wouldn\\'t mind getting a cup of coffee or something\\nRoss? All this time? Well, I\\'ve got to talk to him\\n(quickly) H-He\\'s in China\\nThe country\\nNo, no, wait. (checks Ross\\'s itinerary) His flight doesn\\'t leave for another forty-five more minutes\\nWhat about the time difference\\nFrom here to the airport\\nYes! (Rachel walks towards door) You\\'re never gonna make it\\nRachel, what\\'re you gonna say to him\\nI-I-I don\\'t know\\nWell then maybe you shouldn\\'t go\\nHe\\'s right, cause if you\\'re just gonna, like, break his heart, that\\'s the kind of thing that can wait\\nYeah, but if it\\'s good news, you should tell him now\\nI don\\'t know. Maybe I\\'ll know when I see him\\nHere, look, alright, does this help\\nNoooo... look, all I know is that I cannot wait a week until I see him. I mean, this is just too big. Y\\'know, I just, I\\'ve just gotta talk to him. I... I gotta... OK, I\\'ll see you later\\nRachel, I love you! Deal with me first\\nAirport, Ross has headphones on, and is listening to a \\'How To Speak Chinese\\' tape. Occasionally, he makes an outburst in Chinese in accordance with the tape. He is getting on the jetway. The flight attendant is there\\nAlright\\nNi-chou chi-ma\\nRoss! Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me...\\nHi\\nHi\\nMay I see your boarding pass\\nOh, no, no, I don\\'t have one. I just need to talk to my friend\\nOh, oooh. I\\'m sorry. You are not allowed on the jetway unless you have a boarding pass\\nNo, I know, but IÑhe just went on. He\\'s right there, he\\'s got the blue jacket on, I... can I j-just..\\nNo no no! Federal regulations\\nOK, alright, OK, um... then could you please, uh... just give him a message for me? Please? This is very important\\nAlright. What\\'s the message\\nUh... I don\\'t know\\nSir? Sir? Excuse me, sir? Uh... I have a message for you\\n(confused) What\\nIt\\'s from Rachel. She said that she loved the present, and she will see you when you get back\\n(to wife): Toby... Oh, for God\\'s sake, I don\\'t know what she\\'s talking about! There\\'s no Rachel! Don\\'t give me that deep freeze\\nJoey\\'s Bedroom, he and Melanie are in bed together\\nMmmmmm... Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey... I think I blacked out there for a minute\\nHeh, heh. It was nothin\\'\\nWell, now we\\'ve gotta find something fun for you\\n(panicked) Uhhh.. y\\'know what? Forget about me. Let\\'s, uh... let\\'s give you another turn\\n(surprised) M-Me again\\nSure! Why not\\nBoy, somebody\\'s gonna get a big fruit basket tomorrow\\nOooh, I gotta tell you... you are nothing like I thought you would be\\nHow do you mean\\nI don\\'t know, I-I guess I just had you pegged as one of those guys who\\'re always \\'me, me, me.\\' But you... you\\'re a giver. You\\'re like the most generous man I ever met. I mean... you\\'re practically a woman\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, Monica, Phoebe, and Rachel are there. Monica is holding the wrapping paper from one of Rachel\\'s gifts\\nUh, so, uh, Rach, uh... do you wanna save this wrapping paper, I mean, it\\'s only a little bit torn... so are you gonna go for it with Ross or should I just throw it out\\nI don\\'t know. I don\\'t know... I thought about it all the way there, and I thought about it all the way back... and, uh, oh, you guys, y\\'know, it\\'s Ross. Y\\'know what I mean? I mean, it\\'s Ross\\nSure\\nI don\\'t know, I mean, this is just my initial gut feeling... but I\\'m thinking... oh, I\\'m thinking it\\'d be really great\\nOh my God, me too! Oh! Oh, we\\'d be like friends-in-law! Y\\'know what the best part is? The best part is that you already know everything about him! I mean, it\\'s like starting on the fifteenth date\\nYeah, but, y\\'know, it\\'s... it would be like starting on the fifteenth date\\nAnother good point\\nNo, I mean, I mean, when you\\'re at the fifteenth date, y\\'know, you\\'re already in a very relationshippy place. Y\\'know, it\\'s... you\\'re committed\\n(confused) Huh\\nWell, I mean, then what happens if it doesn\\'t work out\\nWhy isn\\'t it working out\\nI don\\'t know... sometimes it doesn\\'t\\nIs he not cute enough for you\\nNo\\nDoes he not make enough money\\nNo, I\\'m just...\\nMaybe there\\'s someone else\\nWha..\\nIs there? Is there someone else\\nNo! There is.. there is noone else\\nThen why the hell are you dumping my brother?!\\nChandler and Joey\\'s, Chandler is eating breakfast, Joey quietly opens his bedroom door\\nHey, big..\\nShhhh\\n(quietly) ...spender\\nShe\\'s still asleep\\nSo how\\'d it go\\nOh, it was amazing. You know how you always think you\\'re great in bed\\nThe fact that you\\'d even ask that question shows how little you know me\\nWell, it\\'s like, last night, I couldn\\'t do the thing that usually makes me great. So I had to do all this other stuff. And the response I got... man, oh man, it was like a ticker tape parade\\nYes, I know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route\\nIt was amazing! And not just for her... uh-uh. For me, too. It\\'s like, all of a sudden, I\\'m blind. But all my other senses are heightened, y\\'know? It\\'s like... I was able to appreciate it on another level\\nI didn\\'t know you had another level\\nI know! Neither did I\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s, one week later. Monica is seated, Rachel comes out of her bedroom\\nHey, great skirt! Birthday present\\nYeah\\nOh, from who\\nFrom you. I exchanged the blouse you got me\\nWell, it\\'s the thought. Hey, doesn\\'t Ross\\'s flight get in in a couple hours? At gate 27-B\\nUh, yeah. Uh, Monica, y\\'know, honey, I\\'ve been thinking about it and I\\'ve decided thisÑthis whole Ross thing, it\\'s just not a good idea\\nOh, why\\nBecause, I feel like I wouldn\\'t just be going out with him. I would be going out with all of you. Oh, and there would just be all this pressure, and I don\\'t wanna..\\n(gets up) No, no, no, no, no, no pressure, no pressure\\nMonica, nothing has even happened yet, and you\\'re already so..\\nI am not \\'so\\'! OK, I was a teensy bit weird at first, but... I\\'ll be good. I promise\\nWho is it\\nIt\\'s me, Carl\\nC\\'mon up\\nBehind my brother\\'s back? (Rachel glares at her) ... is exactly the kind of crazy thing you won\\'t be hearing from me\\nChandler and Joey\\'s, Chandler is seated, and the apartment is filled with baskets of fruit. Joey enters, check in hand\\nSeven hundred bucks\\nAlright, you did it! Do we have any fruit\\nMan, hell of a two weeks, huh? Y\\'know what, though? I really feel like I learned something\\nReally? So, you\\'re gonna stick with this \\'it\\'s all for her\\' thing\\nWhat, are you crazy? When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk around like this? (Joey closes his eyes and walks around with arms spread\\nMonica and Rachel\\'s Balcony, Rachel is having drinks with her date, Carl\\nI\\'m just sayin\\', if I see one more picture of Ed Begley, Jr. in that stupid electric car, I\\'m gonna shoot myself! I mean, don\\'t get me wrong... I\\'m not against environmental issues per se.... it\\'s just that guy\\nI can\\'t believe you\\'d rather go out with him than me\\nWould you excuse me, please? I\\'m trying to have a date here\\nFine, just stop thinking about me\\nCan\\'t do it, can you\\nSo I\\'m thinking about you. So what\\nI don\\'t get it. What do you see in this guy, anyway\\nWell... he happens to be a very nice... guy...\\nI mean, come on, buddy, get a real car\\nRachel, come on. Give us a chance\\nRoss, it\\'s too hard\\nNo, no, no... why, because it might get weird for everyone else? Who cares about them. This is about us. Look, I-I\\'ve been in love with you since, like, the ninth grade\\nRoss, you\\'re like my best friend\\nI know\\nIf we broke up, and I lost you..\\nWhoa, whoa, whoa. What makes you think we\\'re gonna break up\\nWell, have you been involved with someone where you haven\\'t broken up\\n(pause) No. But... it only has to happen once. Look, you and I both know we are perfect for each other, right? I mean... so, the only question is... are you attracted to me\\nI don\\'t know... I mean, I\\'ve never looked at you that way before\\nWell, start looking\\nWow\\nExactly! And you just know I\\'m gonna be the guy caught behind this hammerhead in traffic\\nRight! You\\'re right\\nHeh... y\\'know\\nYou know what\\nWhat\\nI forgot... I am supposed to pick up a friend at the airport. I am so sorry! I\\'m so... if you want to stay, and finish your drinks, please do.... (gives him her drink) I meanÑI\\'m sorry. I-I-I gotta go. I\\'m sorry\\nBut..\\nAirport. Madonna\\'s Take A Bow plays in the background as Rachel waits at the gate with flowers\\n(sifting through crowd) Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me, excuse me, sorry. Hi\\nFor God\\'s sake, will you let it go? There\\'s no Rachel\\nOh, hey, hey, I got that\\nOh, thanks, sweetie\\nNo problem. I cannot wait for you to meet my friends\\nReally\\nYeah\\nYou don\\'t think they\\'ll judge and ridicule me\\nNo, no, they will. I just... uh..\\nCan\\'t wait\\nCome on, they\\'re gonna love you'"

Now I don\\'t know what to do, everybody starts looking at me And they weren\\'t looking at you before? Finally, I figure I\\'d better answer it, and it turns out it\\'s my mother, which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me (mortified) Hi This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself Are you okay, sweetie I just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck.. Cookie (explaining to the others) Carol moved her stuff out today Ohh (to Ross) Let me get you some coffee Thanks Ooh! Oh! (She starts to pluck at the air just in front of Ross No, no don\\'t!

(to Rachel) This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross Hi, sure Hi So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids Oh God... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden- (to the waitress that brought her coffee)Sweet \\'n\\' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that\\'s when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y\\'know, I mean, I always knew looked familiar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering \\'Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?\\'. (to Monica) So anyway I just didn\\'t know where to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you\\'re the only person I knew who lived here in the city Who wasn\\'t invited to the wedding Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn\\'t be an issue... [Scene: Monica\\'s Apartment, everyone is there and watching a Spanish Soap on TV and are trying to figure out what is going on Now I\\'m guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she\\'s really not happy about it (imitating the characters) Tuna or egg salad?Ê Decide (in a deep voice) I\\'ll have whatever Christine is having (on phone) Daddy, I just...

Well maybe I\\'ll just stay here with Monica Well, I guess we\\'ve established who\\'s staying here with Monica.. Well, maybe that\\'s my decision. Well, maybe I don\\'t need your money. Wait!! Wait, I said maybe! Just breathe, breathe.. that\\'s it. Just try to think of nice calm things.. (sings) Raindrops on roses and rabbits and kittens, (Rachel and Monica turn to look at her.) bluebells and sleighbells and- something with mittens... La la la la...something and noodles with string.Ê These are a few.. I\\'m all better now (grins and walks to the kitchen and says to Chandler and Joey.)

I have no brackety thing, I see no whim guys whatsoever and- I cannot feel my legs I\\'m thinking we\\'ve got a bookcase here It\\'s a beautiful thing (picking up a leftover part) What\\'s this I would have to say that is an \\'L\\'-shaped bracket Which goes where I have no idea Done with the bookcase All finished (clutching a beer can and sniffing) This was Carol\\'s favorite beer. She always drank it out of the can, I should have known Hey-hey-hey-hey, if you\\'re gonna start with that stuff we\\'re outta here Yes, please don\\'t spoil all this fun Ross, let me ask you a question. She got the furniture, the stereo, the good TV- what did you get You guys Oh, God You got screwed Oh my God A Restaurant, Monica and Paul are eating Oh my God I know, I know, I\\'m such an idiot.

How did you get through it -leg (laughing) That\\'s one way!

(Chandler hits what he is working on with a hammer and it collapses That only took me an hour Look, Ross, you gotta understand, between us we haven\\'t had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento. Ê You, however have had the love of a woman for four years. Ê Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and that is why we don\\'t do it!Ê I don\\'t think that was my point You know what the scariest part is? What if there\\'s only one woman for everybody, y\\'know? I mean what if you get one woman- and that\\'s it? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her.. What are you talking about? \\'One woman\\'? That\\'s like saying there\\'s only one flavor of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something, Ross. There\\'s lots of flavors out there. There\\'s Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing! Cherry Vanilla. You could get \\'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the best thing that ever happened to you!

My mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was back in prison, and I got here, and I didn\\'t know anybody. And I ended up living with this albino guy who was, like, cleaning windshields outside port authority, and then he killed himself, and then I found aromatherapy.

Okay... okay, maybe I will.. Goodnight Goodnight See ya.... Waitwait, what\\'s with you I just grabbed a spoon. (Ross exits and Monica has no idea what that means Central Perk, everyone is there I can\\'t believe what I\\'m hearing here (sings) I can\\'t believe what I\\'m hearing here..

What you guys don\\'t understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it Yeah, right!.......Y\\'serious Oh, yeah Everything you need to know is in that first kiss Absolutely Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y\\'know? I mean it\\'s like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out Yeah, and-and it\\'s not that we don\\'t like the comedian, it\\'s that-that... that\\'s not why we bought the ticket The problem is, though, after the concert\\'s over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y\\'know? I mean, we\\'re in the car, we\\'re fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake Yeah, well, word of advice: Bring back the comedian. Otherwise next time you\\'re gonna find yourself sitting at home, listening to that album alone (pause)....Are we still talking about sex Museum of Prehistoric History, Ross and a co-worker (Marsha) are setting up an exhibit which includes some mannequins of cave people No, it\\'s good, it is good, it\\'s just that- mm- doesn\\'t she seem a little angry Well, she has issues Does she He\\'s out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet Marsha, these are cave people.

Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn\\'t need it, so I balled it up and... (sees that Monica is glaring at him) ...now I wish I was dead She\\'s already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you\\'ve already fluffed that- (Monica glares at her.) -but, it\\'s fine Look , I\\'m sorry, guys, I just don\\'t wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child\\'s pillow Monica- Hi! Um, Monica, you\\'re scaring me. I mean, you\\'re like, you\\'re like all chaotic and twirly. And not-not in a good way Yeah, calm down. You don\\'t see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come That\\'s because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y\\'see, he\\'s the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born (looking out the window) Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew What Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster Eeaagh Has anybody seen my engagement ring Yeah, it\\'s beautiful Oh God, oh God, oh God oh God oh God oh God....

(She starts to fluff the same pillow Monica fluffed multiple times earlier Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please Yeah. (They go to the kitchen Oh, we\\'re having spaghetti! That\\'s.... easy I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me What that Rachel did to her life.... We ran into her parents at the club, they were not playing very well I\\'m not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding... but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar.. What\\'s that supposed to mean Nothing! It\\'s an expression No it\\'s not Don\\'t listen to your mother. You\\'re independent, and you always have been! Even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were just fine! And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles.. Look, there are people like Ross who need to shoot for the stars, with his museum, and his papers getting published. Other people are satisfied with staying where they are- I\\'m telling you, these are the people who never get cancer ...And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God \\'Our Little Harmonica\\' doesn\\'t seem to have that problem (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what\\'s going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here\\'s the deal. Carol\\'s a lesbian.

(she gets extremely wound up, and begins to try and calm herself down) Stop it, stop it, stop it The laundromat Ok, I know this is gonna sound really stupid, but I feel that if I can do this, you know, if I can actually do my own laundry, there isn\\'t anything I can\\'t do That does not sound stupid to me. You know, it\\'s like the first time I had to make dinner for myself, after Carol left me? (the buzzer on the washer goes off) I\\'m sorry, that\\'s all the time we have.

I mean, do you think there are people who go through life never having that kind of.. Probably. But you know, I\\'ll tell you something. Passion is way overrated Yeah right It is. Eventually, it kind of... burns out. But hopefully, what you\\'re left with is trust, and security, and... well, in the case of my ex-wife, lesbianism. So, you know, for all of those people who miss out on that passion... thing, there\\'s all that other good stuff (sigh) OK But, um... I don\\'t think that\\'s going to be you You don\\'t Uh-uh.

What\\'s messing you up? The wine? The candles? The moonlight? You\\'ve just got to go up to her and say, \\'Rachel, I think that..

Five hours from now, shoop, shoop, shoop Oh, you must stop shooping Ok, I\\'m gonna get my stuff Chandler, will you just come in already No, I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment Look out, incoming pumpkin pie Ok, we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that\\'s not funny anymore Hey, Monica, I got a question. I don\\'t see any tater tots That\\'s not a question But my mom always makes them. It\\'s like a tradition. You get a little piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a tot! It\\'s bad enough I can\\'t be with my family because of my disease All right, fine. Tonight\\'s potatoes will be both mashed with lumps, and in the form of tots Ok, I\\'m off to talk to my unborn child Ah Ok, Mom never hit (stirring pot) Ok, all done What, Phoebe, did you whip the potatoes? Ross needs lumps Oh, I\\'m sorry, oh, I just, I thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions Why would we do that Well, \\'cause then they\\'d be like my mom used to make them, you know, before she died Ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up Ok, good-bye you guys. Thanks for everything. (she starts to leave, and hits everyone with her skis) Oh, sorry! Oh, sorry The most unbelievable thing has happened. Underdog has just gotten away The balloon No, no, the actual cartoon character. Of course the balloon. It\\'s all over the news. Right before he reached Macy\\'s, he broke free and was spotted flying over Washington Square Park. I\\'m goin\\' to the roof, who\\'s with me I can\\'t, I gotta go Come on. An 80-foot inflatable dog let loose over the city. How often does that happen Almost never Got the keys? or Got the keys Ok Carol and Susan\\'s, Ross is preparing to talk to her belly Anytime you\\'re ready Ok, ok, here we go. (he crouches down near her stomach) Ok, where am I talking to, here? I mean, uh, well, there is one way that seems to offer a certain acoustical advantage, but.. Just aim for the bump Ok, ok, ok, ok, here goes. You know, I, you know, can\\'t do this. Uh, this is too weird. I feel stupid So don\\'t do it, it\\'s fine. You don\\'t have to do it just because Susan does it (quickly talking) Hello, baby. Hello, hello Monica and Rachel\\'s, the group is coming back from the roof I loved the moment when you first saw the giant dog shadow all over the park Yeah, but did they have to shoot him down? I mean, that was just mean Ok, right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. Why are we standing here We\\'re waiting for you to open the door. You got the keys No I don\\'t Yes, you do. When we left, you said, \"got the keys No I didn\\'t. I asked, \"got the ke-eys No, no, no, you said, \"got the keys\" Do either of you have the keys (panicked) The oven is on Oh, I gotta get my ticket Wait, wait, we have a copy of your key Well then get it, get it That tone will not make me go any faster (angry) Joey That one will Carol and Susan\\'s, Carol is reading, Ross is talking to her stomach And everyone\\'s telling me, you gotta pick a major, you gotta pick a major. So, on a dare, I picked paleontology. And you have no idea what I\\'m saying, because, let\\'s face it, you\\'re a fetus. You\\'re just happy you don\\'t have gills anymore Look, you don\\'t have to talk to it. You can sing to it if you want Oh, please. I am not singing to your stomach, ok Hi, how\\'s it goin Shh! (singing) Here we come, walkin\\' down the street, get the funniest looks from, everyone we meet. Hey, hey! (to Carol) Hey, uh, did you just feel that I did Does it always, uh-- No, no that was the first Keep singing! Keep singing (singing) Hey, hey, you\\'re my baby, and I can\\'t wait to meet you. When you come out I\\'ll buy you a bagel, and then we\\'ll go to the zoo I felt it (singin) Hey, hey, I\\'m your daddy. I\\'m the one without any breasts The Hallway, Joey has a tray full of keys, and is trying each one in the lock Nope, not that one Can you go any faster with that Hey, I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys. You do the math Why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway (sarcastic) For an emergency just like this (grabs Chandler by the shirt) All right, listen, smirky. If it wasn\\'t for you and your stupid balloon, I would be on a plane watching a woman do this (makes a gesture like a stewardess pointing out exits) right now. But I\\'m not I swear you said you had the keys No, I didn\\'t. I wouldn\\'t say I had the keys unless I had the keys, and I obviously didn\\'t have the keys Ooh, ok, that\\'s it. Enough with the keys. No one say keys Why would I have the keys Aside from the fact that you said you had them But I didn\\'t Well, you should have Why Because Why Because Why? Because everything is my responsibility? Isn\\'t it enough that I\\'m making Thanksgiving dinner for everyone? You know, everyone wants a different kind of potatoes, so I\\'m making different kinds of potatoes. Does anybody care what kind of potatoes I want? Nooooo, no, no! (starting to cry) Just as long as Phoebe gets her peas and onions, and Mario gets his tots, and it\\'s my first Thanksgiving, and it\\'s all burned, and, and I... I.. Ok, Monica, only dogs can hear you now, so, look, the door\\'s open. Here we go Well, the turkey\\'s burnt. (checking pots) Potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined Here we come, walkin\\' down theÑthis doesn\\'t smell like Mom\\'s No, it doesn\\'t, does it? But you wanted lumps, Ross? (picks up the pan of badly burnt potatoes) Well, here you go, buddy, ya got one Oh, god, this is great! The plane is gone, so it looks like I\\'m stuck here with you guys Hey, we all had better plans. This was nobody\\'s first choice Oh, really? So why was I busting my ass to make this delicious Thanksgiving dinner You call that delicious Stop it, stop it, stop it Now this feels like Thanksgiving Ooh What Ugly Naked Guy\\'s taking his turkey out of the oven. Oh my god. He\\'s not alone. Ugly Naked Guy\\'s having Thanksgiving dinner with Ugly Naked Gal I\\'ve gotta see this. All right Ugly Naked Guy Ooh, Ugly Naked Dancing It\\'s nice that he has someone Shall I carve By all means Ok, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese I don\\'t even wanna know about the dark cheese (holding sandwich) Does anybody wanna split this with me Oh, I will Ooh, you guys have to make a wish Make a wish Come on, you know, Thanksgiving. Ooh, you got the bigger half. What\\'d you wish for The bigger half I\\'d like to propose a toast. Little toast here, ding ding. I know this isn\\'t the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn\\'t involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you\\'d gone to Vail, and if you guys\\'d been with your family, if you didn\\'t have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn\\'t be all together, you know? So I guess what I\\'m trying to say is that I\\'m very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked That\\'s so sweet And hey, here\\'s to a lousy Christmas And a crappy New Year Here, here The Subway, Joey sees his poster and he peels off the caption on his poster, revealing more posters underneath Monica and Rachel\\'s, Ross is entering Guys? There\\'s a somebody I\\'d like you to meet Oooh W-wait. What is that \\'That\\' would be Marcel. You wanna say hi No, no, I don\\'t Oh, he is precious! Where did you get him My friend Bethel rescued him from some lab That is so cruel! Why? Why would a parent name their child Bethel Hey, that monkey\\'s got a Ross on its ass Ross, is he gonna live with you, like, in your apartment Yeah. I mean, it\\'s been kinda quiet since Carol left, so.. Why don\\'t you just get a roommate Nah, I dunno... I think you reach a certain age, having a roommate is kinda pathe- (Realises) ....sorry, that\\'s, that\\'s \\'pathet\\', which is Sanskrit for \\'really cool way to live\\' Central Perk, Phoebe is getting ready to sing. Joey is not there So you guys, I\\'m doing all new material tonight. I have twelve new songs about my mother\\'s suicide, and one about a snowman Might wanna open with the snowman Hey, Joey. Hey, buddy So, how\\'d it go Ahhhhhh, I didn\\'t get the job How could you not get it? You were Santa last year I dunno. Some fat guy\\'s sleeping with the store manager. He\\'s not even jolly, it\\'s all political So what are you gonna be Ah, I\\'m gonna be one of his helpers. It\\'s just such a slap in the face, y\\'know Hey, do you guys know what you\\'re doing for New Year\\'s? (They all protest and hit her with cushions) Gee, what?! What is wrong with New Year\\'s Nothing for you, you have Paolo. You don\\'t have to face the horrible pressures of this holiday: desperate scramble to find anything with lips just so you can have someone to kiss when the ball drops!! Man, I\\'m talking loud Well, for your information, Paolo is gonna be in Rome this New Year, so I\\'ll be just as pathetic as the rest of you Yeah, you wish It\\'s just that I\\'m sick of being a victim of this Dick Clark holiday. I say this year, no dates, we make a pact. Just the six of us- dinner Yeah, okay. Alright Y\\'know, I was hoping for a little more enthusiasm Woooo! Yeah Phoebe, you\\'re on Oh, oh, good (Into microphone) Okay, hi. Ladies and gentlemen, back by popular demand, Miss Phoebe Buffay. Wooh (Takes mike) Thanks, hi. Um, I wanna start with a song that means a lot to me this time of year No. No, that\\'s- that\\'s okay Well, c\\'mon, if it\\'s important enough to discuss while I\\'m playing, then I assume it\\'s important enough for everyone else to hear (Quietly, to the others) That guy\\'s going home with a note Could you speak up please (Stands up and speaks more loudly) Sorry, I wa- I was just saying to my friend that I thought you were the most beautiful woman that I\\'d ever seen in my- in my life Daryl Hannah Hard quality -hard quality. And uh, while Daryl Hannah is beautiful in a conventional way, you are luminous with a kind of a delicate grace. Then, uh, that-that-that\\'s when you started yelling Okay, we\\'re gonna take a short break Hey, that guy\\'s going home with more than a note Monica and Rachel\\'s, everyone except Joey is decorating for Christmas Come here, Marcel. Sit here Pheebs, I can\\'t believe he hasn\\'t kissed you yet. I mean God, by my sixth date with Paolo, I mean he had already named both my breasts! ...Ooh. Did I just share too much Just a smidge David\\'s like, y\\'know, Scientist Guy. He\\'s very methodical I think it\\'s romantic Me too! Oh! Did you ever see An Officer and a Gentleman Yeah Well, he\\'s kinda like the guy I went to see that with. Except, except he-he\\'s smarter, and gentler, and sweeter... I just- I just wanna be with him all the time. Day and night, and night and day... and special occasions.. Wait a minute, wait a minute, I see where this is going, you\\'re gonna ask him to New Year\\'s, aren\\'t you. You\\'re gonna break the pact. She\\'s gonna break the pact No, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah, could I just Yeah, \\'cause I already asked Janice What? C\\'mon, this was a pact! This was your pact I snapped, okay? I couldn\\'t handle the pressure and I snapped Yeah, but Janice? That-that was like the worst breakup in history I\\'m not saying it was a good idea, I\\'m saying I snapped Hi. Hi, sorry I\\'m late Too many jokes... must mock Joey Nice shoes, huh Aah, y\\'killing me Ross! He\\'s playing with my spatulas again Okay, look, he\\'s not gonna hurt them, right Do you always have to bring him here I didn\\'t wanna leave him alone. Alright? We- we had our first fight this morning. I think it has to do with my working late. I said some things that I didn\\'t mean, and he- he threw some faeces.. Y\\'know, if you\\'re gonna work late, I could look in on him for you Oh, that\\'d be great! Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you\\'re there to see him, okay, and you\\'re not like doing it as a favour to me Okay, but if he asks, I\\'m not going to lie Max and David\\'s lab, David is explaining something to Phoebe with the aid of a whiteboard ...But, you can\\'t actually test this theory, because today\\'s particle accelerators are nowhere near powerful enough to simulate these conditions Okay, alright, I have a question, then Yuh Um, were you planning on kissing me ever Uh, that\\'s definitely a, uh, valid question. And, uh, the answer would be (Writes YES on the board) yes. Yes I was. But, see, I wanted it to be this phenomenal kiss that happened at this phenomenal moment, because, well, \\'cause it\\'s you Sure Right. But, see, the longer I waited, the more phenomenal the kiss had to be, and now we\\'ve reached a place where it\\'s just gotta be one of those things where I just like... sweep everything off the table and throw you down on it. And, uh, I\\'m not really a, uh, sweeping sorta fella Oh, David, I, I think you are a sweeping sorta fella. I mean, you\\'re a sweeper! ...trapped inside a physicist\\'s body Rrrreally Oh, yeah, oh, I\\'m sure of it. You should just do it, just sweep and throw me ...Now? Now Oh yeah, right now Okay, okay, okay. (Gets ready to sweep, and then picks up a laptop computer) Y\\'know what, this was just really expensive. (Puts it down elsewhere. Then picks up a microscope) And I\\'ll take- this was a gift Okay, now you\\'re just kinda tidying Okay, what the hell, what the hell. (Sweeps the remaining papers off the desk and grabs Phoebe) You want me to actually throw you or you-you wanna just hop I can hop Central Perk, everyone is there So tell me something. What does the phrase \\'no date pact\\' mean to you I\\'m sorry, okay. It\\'s just that Chandler has somebody, and Phoebe has somebody- I thought I\\'d ask Fun Bobby Fun Bobby?

Why would I why? Why? Why? Why I don\\'t know. Maybe maybe low self-esteem, maybe maybe to compensate for overshadowing a sibling, maybe you.. Wait-wait, go back to that sibling thing Well, I don\\'t know. I mean, it\\'s conceivable that you wanted to sabotage your marriage so that the sibling would feel less of a failure in the eyes of the parents That that\\'s ridiculous! I don\\'t feel guilty for her failures Oh! So you think I\\'m a failure Isn\\'t he good Nonono, thatthat\\'s not what I was saying.. Y\\'know, all these years, I thought you were on my side.

I can\\'t sleep in my underwear Well, you\\'re gonna I\\'ve been thinking. Y\\'know, about how I\\'m always seeing girls on top of girls.. Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes Y\\'know what I mean, about how I\\'m always going out with all these women. And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I\\'d be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y\\'know? Now I\\'m looking at my dad, thinking.. Hey, you\\'re not him. You\\'re you. When they were all over you to go into your father\\'s pipe-fitting business, did you cave No No. You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business. Now that wasn\\'t easy, but you did it! And I\\'d like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say \"No thanks, I\\'m married You really think so Yeah. I really do Thanks, Chandler Get off Monica and Rachel\\'s, morning. Someone knocks on the door and Monica gets it Hi Hi...May I help you Yeah, uh, Joey said I could use your shower, since, uh, Chandler\\'s in ours Okay...who are you Oh, I\\'m Ronni. Ronni Rappelano?

Fasten your seatbelts, it\\'s peepee time. (She goes into Joey and Chandler\\'s apartment, where Mr. Tribbiani is reading the paper) Hey, Mr. Trib Hey. Morning, dear Chandler Bing? It\\'s time to see your thing (Runs out in a towel) What\\'s the matter with you? I thought it was Chandler (Comes out of his room) What?

Roger\\'s having a dinner thing and he wanted me to invite you guys So what\\'s going on Nothing, um, it\\'s just, um... It\\'s Roger I dunno, there\\'s just something about.. Basically we just feel that he\\'s.. We hate that guy Yeah. Hate him We\\'re sorry, Pheebs, we\\'re sorry Uh-huh. Okay. Okay, don\\'t you think, maybe, though, it\\'s just that he\\'s so perceptive that it freaks you out ...No, we hate him We\\'re sorry Chandler and Joey\\'s apartment, Joey is trying to turn the sofabed back into a sofa. Someone knocks on the door and it rears up at him Ma! What\\'re you doing here I came to give you this (Gives him a bag of groceries) and this Oww! Big ring Why did you have to fill your father\\'s head with all that garbage about making things right? Things were fine the way they were! There\\'s chicken in there, put it away. For God\\'s sake, Joey, really Hold on, you-you knew Of course I knew! What did you think? Your father is no James Bond. You should\\'ve heard some of his cover stories. \"I\\'m sleeping over at my accountant\\'s,\" I mean, what is that? Please So then how could you I mean, how could you? Do you remember how your father used to be? Always yelling, always yelling nothing made him happy, nothing made him happy, not that wood shop, not those stupid little ships in the bottle, nothing. Now he\\'s happy! I mean, it\\'s nice, he has a hobby Ma, I don\\'t mean to be disrespectful, but... what the hell are you talking about?! I mean, what about you Me? I\\'m fine. Look, honey, in an ideal world, there\\'d be no her, and your father would look like Sting. And I\\'ll tell you something else. Ever since that poodle-stuffer came along, he\\'s been so ashamed of himself that he\\'s been more attentive, he\\'s been more loving... I mean, it\\'s like every day\\'s our anniversary I\\'m...happy...for you Well don\\'t be, because now everything\\'s screwed up. I just want it the way it was Ma, I\\'m sorry. I just did what I thought you\\'d want I know you did, cookie. Oh, I know you did. So tell me. Did you see her Yeah. You\\'re ten times prettier than she is That\\'s sweet. Could I take her With this ring? (Her engagement ring.) No contest Central Perk. Phoebe is there with Roger What\\'s wrong, sweetie Nothing, nothing Aaaah, what\\'s wrong, c\\'mon. (Pats his leg It\\'s, I mean, it\\'s nothing, I\\'m fine. It\\'s my friends. They-they have a liking problem with you. In that, um, they don\\'t Oh. They don\\'t But they don\\'t see all the wonderfulness that I see. They don\\'t see all the good stuff and all the sweet stuff. They just think you\\'re a little.. What Intense and creepy Oh But I don\\'t. Me, Phoebe Well, I\\'m not I\\'m not at all surprised they feel that way You\\'re not? See, that\\'s why you\\'re so great Actually it\\'s, it\\'s quite, y\\'know, typical behaviour when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic. Y\\'know, this kind of co-dependant, emotionally stunted, sitting in your stupid coffee house with your stupid big cups which, I\\'m sorry, might as well have nipples on them, and you\\'re like all \\'Oh, define me! Define me! Love me, I need love!\\' Monica and Rachel\\'s, Joey is letting everyone in on the new developments So you talked to your dad, huh Yeah. He\\'s gonna keep cheating on my ma like she wanted, she\\'s gonna keep pretending she doesn\\'t know even though she does, and my little sister Tina can\\'t see her husband any more because he got a restraining order...which has nothing to do with anything except that I found out today Wow Things sure have changed here on Waltons mountain So Joey, you okay Yeah, I guess. It\\'s just parents, after a certain point, you gotta let go. Even if you know better, you\\'ve gotta let them make their own mistakes Just think, in a couple of years we get to turn into them If I turn into my parents, I\\'ll either be an alcoholic blond chasing after twenty-year-old boys, or... I\\'ll end up like my mom (entering) Hey Hey, Pheebs How\\'s it going Oh, okay, except I broke up with Roger Awww Yeah, right Aaawwwwww! What happened I don\\'t know, I mean, he\\'s a good person, and he can be really sweet, and in some ways I think he is so right for me, it\\'s just... I hate that guy Monica and Rachel\\'s. Phoebe is reading the paper and Joey enters Hey, Joey. What\\'s going on Clear the tracks for the boobie payback express. Next stop: Rachel Green. (He goes into the bathroom Joey!!

I know I do Well, what are you guys doing tomorrow night Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes Oh, uh, listen, about tonight.. No, no, no, don\\'t you dare bail on me.

Monica and Rachel\\'s, the girls are all there, discussing their bad luck with men Ok, ok, Roger was creepy, but he was nothing compared to Pete Carney Which one was Pete Carney Pete the Weeper? Remember that guy who used to cry every time we had sex. (imitating) \"Was it good for you Yeah, well, I\\'ll take a little crying any day over Howard-the-\"I-win\"-guy. (imitating) \"I win! I win!\" I went out with the guy for two monthsÑI didn\\'t get to win once How did we end up with these jerks? We\\'re good people I don\\'t know. Maybe we\\'re some kinda magnets I know I am.

One of his co-workers walks by Chandler Mrs. Tedlock. You\\'re looking lovely today. And may I say, that is a very flattering sleeve length on you Yes. Well, Mr. Kostelick wants you to stop by his office at the end of the day Oh, listen. If this is about those prank memos, I had nothing to do with them. Really. Nothing at all. Really. (Chandler tries to hide a rubber chicken from the woman.) Nothing Central Perk, everyone is there but Chandler. Phoebe runs in, excitedly Hey you guys!

But it was going to be really good What\\'s going on What is it So, it\\'s a typical day at work. I\\'m inputting my numbers, and big Al calls me into his office and tells me he wants to make me processing supervisor That\\'s great So.... I quit Why Why? This was supposed to be a temp job Yeah, Chandler... you\\'ve been there for five years If I took this promotion, it\\'d be like admitting that this is what I actually do So was it a lot more money It doesn\\'t matter. I just don\\'t want to be one of those guys that\\'s in his office until twelve o\\'clock at night worrying about the WENUS ... the WENUS Weekly Estimated Net Usage Systems. A processing term (sarcastic) Oh. That WENUS So what\\'re you going to do I don\\'t know. That\\'s the thing. I don\\'t know what I want to do.

You\\'re a chef. I know, and I thought of you first, but um, Chandler\\'s the one who needs a job right now, so... Yeah... I just don\\'t have that much cheffing experience. Unless it\\'s an all-toast restaurant (to Monica\\'s tapping) Yeah, yeah Well, what kind of food is he looking for Well, he wants to do some ecclectic, so he\\'s looking for someone who can, you know, create the entire menu (excited) Oh my God Yeah, I know!

Phoebe enters, but not as herself, for she has changed the style of her hair and make-up to match that of her twin sister. She hangs up her coat, revealing her new cardigan. Nervously, she smooths out the identifying garment, approaching Joey who sits next to the main sofa (as Ursula) Hey Urse.. ..ah, what\\'re you doing here?

You should take her back to the 1890\\'s, when that phrase was last used Monica and Rachel\\'s, Rachel is taking care of Marcel and they are watching a soap opera Now, now the one in the feather boa, that\\'s Dr. Francis. Now, she used to be a man. Okay, now look, see, there\\'s Raven. We hate her. We\\'re glad she\\'s dying. Okay- (Marcel pushes down a cushion to reveal a shoe) Wh- wh- Marcel, are you playing with Monica\\'s shoes? You know you\\'re not supposed to pl- whoah. Marcel, did you poo in the shoe? (Takes the shoe into the kitchen) Marcel, bad monkey! Oh! Oh! (She notices the newsletter and taps the contents of the shoes onto it, then folds it shut) Sorry, Barry. Little engagement gift. I\\'m sure you didn\\'t register for that. (She leaves the apartment holding the newsletter at arm\\'s length. However, she leaves the door open. Marcel runs out in the opposite direction. There is a shot from the TV and Rachel runs back in) Who died? Who died? Roll him over! Oh, c\\'mon, roll him over! Oh...! Well, we know it wasn\\'t Dexter, right Marcel?

Rachel looks round and he acts surprised) The, uh, the neighbours must be vacuuming. (He sits down and starts to pour the wine) Well, so long as we\\'re here and, uh, not on the subject, I was thinking about, uh, how mad we got at each other before, and, um, I was thinking maybe it was partially because of how we, um.. Rachel Barry? I can\\'t. I can\\'t do it, I can\\'t marry Mindy. I think I\\'m still in love with you Oh We have got to start locking that door This is me in The Sound of Music. See the von Trapp kids Nope That\\'s because I\\'m in front of them Eh. I thought that was an alp Well, high school was not my favourite time I dunno, I loved high school. Y\\'know? It was just four years of parties and dating and sex Yeah, well I went to boarding school with four hundred boys. Any sex I had would\\'ve involved a major lifestyle choice Gosh, doesn\\'t it seem like a million years ago Oh. Oooh! Ooh! Ooh! (She stands up and starts to dance around) Ooh! My butt cheek is waking up! Oooh! Ooh Monica and Rachel\\'s, everyone is there I can\\'t believe you would actually say that. I would much rather be Mr.Peanut than Mr.Salty No way!

It was unbelievable! We could totally be ourselves, we didn\\'t have to play any games.. So have you called her yet Let her know I like her? What are you, insane? (The girls make disgusted noises.) It\\'s the next day! How needy do I want to seem? (To the guys) I\\'m right, right Oh, yeah. Yeah. Let her dangle I can\\'t believe my parents are actually pressuring me to find one of you people Oh, God, just do it! (Grabbing the phone.) Call her! Stop being so testosteroney Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat. (Calls her, then hurriedly hangs up.) I got her machine Her answer machine No, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up So, uh, why didn\\'t you say anything Oh, no-no-no-no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up using the phrase \"Yes indeedy-o Look look! It\\'s Rachel and Barry.

He took me to lunch at the Russian Tea Room, and I had that chicken, where y\\'know you poke it and all the butter squirts out.. Not a good day for birds.. Then we took a walk down to Bendall\\'s, and I told him not to, but he got me a little bottle of Chanel.. That\\'s nice... now, was that before or after you told him to stop calling, stop sending you flowers and to generally leave you alone, hmm Right,.. well,.. we never actually got to that... Oh, it was just so nice to see him again, y\\'know? It was comfortable, it was familiar... it was just nice That\\'s, that\\'s nice twice Rachel, what\\'s going on? I mean isn\\'t this the same Barry who you left at the altar Duh, where\\'ve you been Yeah, but it was different with him today! And he wasn\\'t, like, Orthodontist Guy, y\\'know? I mean, we had fun!

Why isn\\'t she calling me back Maybe she never got your message Y\\'know, if you want, you can call her machine, and if she has a lot of beeps, that means she probably didn\\'t get her messages yet Y\\'don\\'t think that makes me seem a little.. ...desperate, needy, pathetic Ah, you obviously saw my personal ad How many beeps She answered Y\\'see, this is where you\\'d use that \\'hello\\' word we talked about I\\'m not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me.

I mean,... how needy is that Monica and Rachel\\'s, everyone is looking at papers How could someone get a hold of your credit card number I have no idea. But look how much they spent Monica, would you calm down? The credit card people said that you only have to pay for the stuff that you bought I know. It\\'s just such reckless spending I think when someone steals your credit card, they\\'ve kind of already thrown caution to the wind Wow, what a geek. They spent $69.95 on a Wonder Mop That\\'s me Oh! The yuk! Ross, he\\'s doing it again Marcel, stop humping the lamp! Stop humping Oh no, not in my room! I\\'ll get him Ross, you\\'ve got to do something about the humping What? It\\'s, it\\'s just a phase Well, that\\'s what we said about Joey.. Would you all relax? It\\'s not that big a deal (Out of shot) Stop it! Marcel! Bad monkey What Let\\'s just say my Curious George doll is no longer curious Monica and Rachel\\'s, late at night Monica is still examining her bill as Rachel emerges from her room Oh, Monica. You are not still going over that thing This woman\\'s living my life What She\\'s living my life, and she\\'s doing it better than me! Look at this, look. She buys tickets for plays that I wanna see. She, she buys clothes from stores that I\\'m intimidated by the sales people. She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies You\\'re not an artist Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all this stuff. Only I don\\'t Oh, Monica, c\\'mon, you do cool things Oh really? Okay, let\\'s compare, shall we (Yawning) Oh, it\\'s so late for \\'Shall we\\'.. Do I go horseback riding in the park? Do I take classes at the New School (Yawning) Nooo.. This is so unfair! She\\'s got everything I want, and she doesn\\'t have my mother Central Perk, Joey and Chandler are discussing stage names How about Joey... Pepponi No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that\\'s more neutral Joey... Switzerland Plus, y\\'know, I think it should be Joe. Y\\'know, Joey makes me sound like I\\'m, I dunno, this big. (Waitress looks at him funny) Which I\\'m not Joe...Joe...Joe...Stalin Stalin...Stalin...do I know that name? It sounds familiar Well, it does not ring a bell with me.. (Writes it down) Joe Stalin. Y\\'know, that\\'s pretty good Might wanna try Joseph Joseph Stalin. I think you\\'d remember that Oh yes! Bye Bye Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin. Joseph Stalin is the Fiddler on the Roof Monica and Rachel\\'s, Monica is there as Phoebe and Rachel enter Hey Hey Hi. (On the phone) Hi, uh, yes, this is Monica Geller.

Central Perk, Ross is entering (Mortified) Hi Hey Where\\'ve you been At the vet She\\'s not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she She says Marcel\\'s humping thing\\'s not a phase. Apparently he\\'s reached sexual maturity (To Chandler) Hey! He beat ya She says as time goes on, he\\'s gonna start getting agressive and violent So what does this mean I\\'m gonna have to give him up Central Perk, scene continued from earlier.Ê They guys are sitting there like the Three Monkeys I can\\'t believe it, Ross. This sucks I don\\'t get it, I mean, you just got him. How can he be an adult already I know. I know. I mean, one day, he\\'s this little thing, and before you know it, he\\'s this little thing I can\\'t get off my leg Isn\\'t there any way you can keep him No, no. The vet says unless he\\'s in a place where he has regular access to some... monkey lovin,\\' he\\'s just gonna get vicious. I\\'ve just gotta get him into a zoo How do you get a monkey into a zoo I know that one! ...No, that\\'s Popes into a Volkswagen Well, we\\'re applying to a lot of them. Naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos, y\\'know, like, uh, San Diego... right? But that might just be a pipe dream, because, y\\'know, he\\'s out of state. Uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at Miami, so that\\'s a possibility Yeah, but that\\'s like two blocks away from the beach. I mean, it\\'s a total party zoo Hey. We found her, we found the girl What Did you call the cops Nope. We took her to lunch Ah. Your own brand of vigilante justice What?! Are you insane? This woman stole from you. She stole. She\\'s a stealer Y\\'know what? After you\\'re with this woman for like ten minutes, you forget all that. I mean, she is this astounding person, with this, with this amazing spirit Yeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader ...Take off their hats Popes in a Volkswagen! ...I love that joke Monica and Rachel\\'s, Monica, Rachel and Fake Monica are there No way. No way did you do this Monana was very brave It was so wild. We told them we were the Gunnersens in room six fifteen. Only to find out the Boston Celtics had taken over the entire sixth floor So once they caught on to the fact that we\\'re, y\\'know, short and have breasts.. ...They threw us out! I was thrown out of a hotel! Me Go Monana! Well, you ladies are not the only ones living the dream. I get to go pour coffee for people I don\\'t know. Don\\'t wait up Oh, by the way, tomorrow we\\'re auditioning for a Broadway show \\'Scuse me There\\'s an open call for Cats. I\\'m thinking we go down there, sing Memories and make complete fools of ourselves. Whaddya say Nononononono. Think who you\\'re dealing with here. I mean, I\\'m not like you. I-I can\\'t even stand in front of a tap class Well, that\\'s just probably \\'cause of your Amish background What Well, you\\'re Pennsylvania Dutch, right Right. Till I bought a blow dryer, then I was shunned I-I used to be just like you. And then one day I saw a movie that changed my life. Did you ever see Dead Poets\\' Society Uh-huh I thought that movie was so incredibly... boring. I mean, that thing at the end where the kid kills himself because he can\\'t be in the play? What was that?! It\\'s like, kid, wait a year, leave home, do some community theatre. I walked out of there and I thought, \\'Now, that\\'s two hours of my life that I\\'m never getting back.\\' And that thought scared me more than all the other crap I was afraid to do Wow. Then I would definitely not recommend Mrs. Doubtfire Monica and Rachel\\'s, tiem lapse.Ê Everyone but Joey and Monica are there (Reading letters) Oh God. (To Marcel) We didn\\'t get into Scranton. (To the others) That was like our safety zoo. They take like dogs and cows. See? I don\\'t know who this is harder on, me or him I\\'d say that chair\\'s taking the brunt Marcel! Marcel! Marcel, no! Good boy. See, how can nobody want him Oh, somebody will (entering) You know there already is a Joseph Stalin You\\'re kidding Apparently he was this Russian dictator who slaughtered all these people. You\\'d think you would\\'ve known that Y\\'know, you\\'d think I would\\'ve Phoebe. Whaddyou think a good stage name for me would be ...Flame Boy Central Perk, Ross is talking to Dr. Baldhara, a zookeeper Where exactly is your zoo Well, it\\'s technically not a zoo per se, it\\'s more of an interactive wildlife experience. Let me ask you some questions about, is it, uh, Marcel Yes Does he, uh, fight with other animals No-no, he\\'s, he\\'s very docile Even if he were... cornered Well I, I don\\'t know. Why Uh, how is he at handling small objects He can hold a banana, if that\\'s whatcha mean.. How about a hammer, or a small blade Why- why- why would he need a blade Well, if he\\'s up against a jungle cat or an animal with horns, you\\'ve got to give the little guy something.

I can\\'t believe he remembered Well, sure, but can you play it on a plane Oh, it\\'s so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune I can\\'t believe he did this Come on, Ross?

I mean, my first night in the city, he mentioned something about asking me out, but nothing ever happened, so I just... (to Joey): W-well, what else did he say? I mean, does he, like, want to go out with me Well, given that he\\'s desperately in love with you, he probably wouldn\\'t mind getting a cup of coffee or something Ross? All this time? Well, I\\'ve got to talk to him (quickly) H-He\\'s in China The country No, no, wait. (checks Ross\\'s itinerary) His flight doesn\\'t leave for another forty-five more minutes What about the time difference From here to the airport Yes! (Rachel walks towards door) You\\'re never gonna make it Rachel, what\\'re you gonna say to him I-I-I don\\'t know Well then maybe you shouldn\\'t go He\\'s right, cause if you\\'re just gonna, like, break his heart, that\\'s the kind of thing that can wait Yeah, but if it\\'s good news, you should tell him now I don\\'t know. Maybe I\\'ll know when I see him Here, look, alright, does this help Noooo... look, all I know is that I cannot wait a week until I see him. I mean, this is just too big. Y\\'know, I just, I\\'ve just gotta talk to him. I... I gotta... OK, I\\'ll see you later Rachel, I love you! Deal with me first Airport, Ross has headphones on, and is listening to a \\'How To Speak Chinese\\' tape. Occasionally, he makes an outburst in Chinese in accordance with the tape. He is getting on the jetway. The flight attendant is there Alright Ni-chou chi-ma Ross! Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me... Hi Hi May I see your boarding pass Oh, no, no, I don\\'t have one.

I mean, it\\'s Ross Sure I don\\'t know, I mean, this is just my initial gut feeling... but I\\'m thinking... oh, I\\'m thinking it\\'d be really great Oh my God, me too! Oh! Oh, we\\'d be like friends-in-law! Y\\'know what the best part is? The best part is that you already know everything about him! I mean, it\\'s like starting on the fifteenth date Yeah, but, y\\'know, it\\'s... it would be like starting on the fifteenth date Another good point No, I mean, I mean, when you\\'re at the fifteenth date, y\\'know, you\\'re already in a very relationshippy place.

You know how you always think you\\'re great in bed The fact that you\\'d even ask that question shows how little you know me Well, it\\'s like, last night, I couldn\\'t do the thing that usually makes me great. So I had to do all this other stuff. And the response I got... man, oh man, it was like a ticker tape parade Yes, I know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route It was amazing! And not just for her... uh-uh. For me, too. It\\'s like, all of a sudden, I\\'m blind. But all my other senses are heightened, y\\'know? It\\'s like... I was able to appreciate it on another level I didn\\'t know you had another level I know! Neither did I Monica and Rachel\\'s, one week later.

Uh, Monica, y\\'know, honey, I\\'ve been thinking about it and I\\'ve decided thisÑthis whole Ross thing, it\\'s just not a good idea Oh, why Because, I feel like I wouldn\\'t just be going out with him. I would be going out with all of you. Oh, and there would just be all this pressure, and I don\\'t wanna.. (gets up) No, no, no, no, no, no pressure, no pressure Monica, nothing has even happened yet, and you\\'re already so.. I am not \\'so\\'! OK, I was a teensy bit weird at first, but...
